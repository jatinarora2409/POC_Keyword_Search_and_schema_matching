I have found the teachers to be excellent. There are three teachers in the classroom, so she gets a lot of individual attention. She has grown more confident, has developed her vocab and general language in both Chinese and English, and can now add and subtract in context. Simona is a very capable head of the preschool and Wendy is a visionary and charismatic founder. The school just hired a new Head of School who brings deep educational experience to launch the Elementary school. He founded a school in China, ran a Mandarin immersion school in the US, and holds a PhD in Education from Columbia. They fill me with confidence.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":625505,\"maponicsId\":1222346,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F25505-Presidio-Knolls-School\u002F\"}],\"schoolGranularRatings\":[],\"greatschoolParentReviewsUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F25505-Presidio-Knolls-School\u002F#Reviews\",\"elementary\":true,\"middle\":true,\"high\":false,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Jul 15, 2020\"}],\"middleSchools\":[{\"servesHome\":false,\"greatSchoolsRating\":3,\"parentRating\":4,\"distanceInMiles\":\"0.2\",\"gradeRanges\":\"K to 8\",\"institutionType\":\"Public\",\"name\":\"Carmichael (bessie)\u002Ffec\",\"schoolUrl\":\"\u002Fschool\u002F192755\u002FCA\u002FSan-Francisco\u002FCarmichael-bessie-fec\",\"searchUrl\":\"\u002Fschool\u002F192755\u002FCA\u002FSan-Francisco\u002FCarmichael-bessie-fec\",\"greatSchoolOverviewUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6346-Carmichael-Bessie-Fec\u002F\",\"id\":192755,\"numberOfStudents\":625,\"fullAddress\":\"375 7th St, San Francisco, CA 94103\",\"isChoice\":true,\"numReviews\":6,\"studentToTeacherRatio\":16,\"websiteUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Ffec-sfusd-ca.Schoolloop.com\",\"schoolReviews\":[{\"schoolId\":16664888,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 18, 2018\",\"review\":\"This used to be a good school but it has quickly gone downhill.

Being in 2 classes gives us the unique opportunity to see how the grade teachers work as a team and collaborate and support each other, a model that is working very well. The school is small and close knit which we love. Parents are very involved and the PTA is fantastic. There are lots of enrichment programs funded by the PTA and we are pleased with the diversity of the education as well as the diversity of the student body.The principal is new and energetic and very well liked and respected by both the parent community and the staff. The start time is not too early for our little ones (8:40) and we had no trouble getting into the after school program, ASEP (which is outstanding) even though we signed up very late.We have a brand new building and facilities this year so everything is fresh and clean and beautiful. We commute in from outside the neighborhood and appreciate the easy freeway access and easy parking around the school. We also love that the kids get to enjoy inspiring hilltop views and sunny Potrero weather! If you are interested in Spanish Immersion and want a bilingual education for your kids, Daniel Webster is an excellent choice. My advice is to hang in there and be patient. You may not get in on the first round, but if you are willing to wait it out, most kids eventually get in. We had to wait until the Wednesday before school started to get the second twin in and we know several kids who got in after the start of the school year.

We were seriously considering Daniel Webster in part due to its proximity to our home, but we were wary of the bad reputation it seemed to have amongst some of the older folks we had met during our house search. Our expectations were pretty low initially due to poor feedback from neighbors who have lost touch with what a GEM this school has become, and the faculty and staff have FAR exceeded those expectations. The primary campus is closed for renovations, and the school had many unknowns leading up to the first day of school, but as far as we can tell they have thought of everything. This school year in a shared building with a high school has run incredibly smoothly! The principal has communicated with parents at regular intervals as well as when there is an unforeseen change or an emergency (and there have been a couple this year). The school community is strong, and many parents are heavily involved--a fact that also makes this school strong and very special. Our child\\u0027s teacher is in her first year, but she is receiving excellent coaching from some of the more seasoned staff. You wouldn\\u0027t know by the way she gracefully conducts a class of twenty or diligently maintains communication with me, an individual parent.

My son has been at Rosa Parks for three years now, and I am getting ready to to send my daughter to kindergarten there. We\\u0027ve tried both the Gen Ed (now with a science\u002Ftechnology focus!) and Japanese programs and are very happy with teachers and school culture in both. The ongoing struggle, as seen in the numbers above, is closing the gap in outcomes between kids from high-income and low-income families. My 2¢ as a parent who has watched two principals and teachers in two programs across three grades, is that the school community as a whole is committed to helping not just kids but families through the big changes shaking up neighborhoods: rising rents, evictions, and the departure of many middle-class families who just can\\u0027t afford the city anymore. The good news is that Rosa Parks has a lot of energetic and engaged parents from all walks of life, and remains deeply connected to both Japanese-American and African-American civil rights movements. Yes, there are two programs, but the school feels unified. The entire school starts the day together in physical activity (alternating Japanese calisthetics and the Cha-Cha Slide), then kids get mixed into combined small groups for reading practice. All the kids spend lots of time with a garden teacher, with the plants and chickens as the basis for science lessons and weekly salad lunches. All the kids see performances at nearby Civic Center arts organizations. All the kids do engineering and science projects in the new hands-on learning studio.

The school also places a strong emphasis on promoting the social and emotional development of its students and creating a strong community and safe learning environment. We came to CACS 3 years ago in part because of our frustration with the heavy emphasis on worksheet-based learning that dominated our older son\\u0027s experience in his SFUSD school.

They each made my son feel capable and interested. His counselor, Miss Sendejo helped him change easily from a class that he felt wasn\\u0027t a good match for him. My son has said things like \\\"I never liked history before having Mr. Lie and Mr Talsky, they make it interesting\\\" He is stuggling in Algebra 2 a bit now, and his teacher comes in in her spare time before school and tutors the kids who need it! Unbelievable. I felt comforted when he started that they keep all of the sixth graders separate, and make them take an intro course to each elective so that when they return as seventh graders they know what they enjoyed most and can spend a full year focused on it. The school also has a fully funded (though impacted) after school program run by Sunset Beacon. Thank you A.P. for the great experience!

Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t. Mission wins on architecture, weather, transportation, location and student to faculty ratio. Lowell wins on academic reputation and performance. Both campuses are equally safe with dedicated staff, though Mission\\u0027s makes more of an effort with more to prove.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":1133732,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":14535080,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Mar 6, 2011\",\"review\":\"i love mission lets go bears go mission is the best decision u could ever make there are the best teachers u can learn really quick the teachers are always pushing u to always do ur best and be positive , peace and love, society ,fashion music and to love ur self and u learn who to develop ur skills and how to protect ursef mission high is not th BAD school as some people out there say\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":1068432,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"}],\"schoolGranularRatings\":[{\"schoolId\":289716,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Low Income\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289713,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Test Scores\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289712,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"College Readiness\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289715,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Equity\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"}],\"schoolDistrict\":{\"id\":14313,\"districtName\":\"San Francisco Unified School District\",\"address\":\"555 Franklin Street\",\"city\":\"San Francisco\",\"stateCode\":\"CA\",\"zip\":\"94102\",\"latitude\":37.7795,\"longitude\":-122.4219,\"websiteUrl\":\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.sfusd.edu\",\"greatschoolDistrictOverviewUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002Fsan-francisco-unified-school-district\u002F\"},\"greatschoolParentReviewsUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F#Reviews\",\"elementary\":false,\"middle\":false,\"high\":true,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 22, 2020\"},{\"servesHome\":false,\"greatSchoolsRating\":1,\"parentRating\":3,\"distanceInMiles\":\"3.7\",\"gradeRanges\":\"9 to 12\",\"institutionType\":\"Charter\",\"name\":\"Life Learning Academy Charter\",\"schoolUrl\":\"\u002Fschool\u002F25275\u002FCA\u002FSan-Francisco\u002FLife-Learning-Academy-Charter\",\"searchUrl\":\"\u002Fschool\u002F25275\u002FCA\u002FSan-Francisco\u002FLife-Learning-Academy-Charter\",\"greatSchoolOverviewUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6393-Life-Learning-Academy-Charter\u002F\",\"id\":25275,\"numberOfStudents\":30,\"fullAddress\":\"651 8th St, San Francisco, CA 94130\",\"isChoice\":true,\"numReviews\":2,\"websiteUrl\":\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.llasf.org\",\"schoolReviews\":[{\"schoolId\":16665049,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Oct 13, 2015\",\"review\":\"Life Learn Life Learning Academy showed up just in time during my eldest Son\\u0027s Sophomore year.

Being in 2 classes gives us the unique opportunity to see how the grade teachers work as a team and collaborate and support each other, a model that is working very well. The school is small and close knit which we love. Parents are very involved and the PTA is fantastic. There are lots of enrichment programs funded by the PTA and we are pleased with the diversity of the education as well as the diversity of the student body.The principal is new and energetic and very well liked and respected by both the parent community and the staff.

We commute in from outside the neighborhood and appreciate the easy freeway access and easy parking around the school. We also love that the kids get to enjoy inspiring hilltop views and sunny Potrero weather! If you are interested in Spanish Immersion and want a bilingual education for your kids, Daniel Webster is an excellent choice. My advice is to hang in there and be patient. You may not get in on the first round, but if you are willing to wait it out, most kids eventually get in.

The primary campus is closed for renovations, and the school had many unknowns leading up to the first day of school, but as far as we can tell they have thought of everything. This school year in a shared building with a high school has run incredibly smoothly! The principal has communicated with parents at regular intervals as well as when there is an unforeseen change or an emergency (and there have been a couple this year). The school community is strong, and many parents are heavily involved--a fact that also makes this school strong and very special. Our child\\u0027s teacher is in her first year, but she is receiving excellent coaching from some of the more seasoned staff. You wouldn\\u0027t know by the way she gracefully conducts a class of twenty or diligently maintains communication with me, an individual parent. I am so thankful for the efforts that have been made by parents and staff alike to turn this school around, and I am excited for my children to be a part of it\\u0027s bright future!

My child reads equally well in Spanish and English, despite neither of us speaking Spanish. I still get chills when I see him speak so effortlessly in Spanish! He loves the science curriculum so much that he checks out nonfiction books at the library to learn more. We took a big chance starting in the SIP program 4 yrs ago and I\\u0027m so glad we did. We\\u0027ve made friends for life and my son has been given an incredible opportunity to become bilingual.

In my opinion, Redding has many different communities rather than one tight-knit one which is such a pity as, in appearance, it\\u0027s clearly very diverse but, like the colors of the rainbow, they remain separate from one another. Much needs to be done to bring the many groups together in the hope that there can be more understanding, acceptance, tolerance, inclusiveness and to inevitably create a more harmonious environment for all.Yes, bullying does occur as with every school but instances do seem to be increasing mainly due to the fact that not much, if anything at all, is done to tackle it. The children are called into to the office for a little chat and swiftly sent back to class... Next!The principal is extremely dedicated and she and her team work incredibly hard to run the school as smoothly as possible, however, she is at times struggling to interact with the many different groups that make up the Redding community in a more impactful and relatable level.All that said, the teachers from TK all the way through to 5th Grade are just pure class and the saving grace.

Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds.

Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t. Mission wins on architecture, weather, transportation, location and student to faculty ratio. Lowell wins on academic reputation and performance.
