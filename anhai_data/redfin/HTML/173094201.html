As we were touring all the private schools in the area, we decided to stop by the Open House at our zoned public school, Gardner - just to see for ourselves how much worse it would be. We were shocked to find that we loved everything about Gardner! The way it looks and feels (happy! Filled with art, music and laughter), and mostly its progressive mindset. We were so shaken up that we went back two more times to confirm that our initial impression was not skewed in some way... Our son is now a thriving 2nd grader at Gardner, and we truly do love this school.Gardner Street Elementary is a neighborhood gem with an engaged principal, excellent teachers and helpful staff, and a small but very active parent body that makes things happen. Many students live outside the school zone but they and their parents like Gardner so much that they\\u0027ve chosen to permit in.What makes Gardner so special are its diverse staff and students, family-like atmosphere, and the many \\\"extras\\\". Thanks to annual fundraisers coupled with lots of fun events for kids and families throughout the school year, \\\"non-essential\\\" classes that are not paid for by LAUSD and not offered in many public schools - such as Visual Art, Music, PE, Yoga, Organic Edible Garden, and (new!) Science Lab - are part of the everyday curriculum and available to every child at Gardner. There are many really great afterschool programs to choose from, and occasional workshops for parents\u002Fcaregivers. Campus beautification is ongoing.Besides all the fun, there is serious learning going on as well. Learning to truly *understand* and not just memorize to ace tests. So much learning goes on at school that - as supported by countless studies and best-performing schools in Finland - there are no homework requirements for the younger kids.Most importantly, my child has developed love for reading and learning, he is excited about going to school every day, and he feels safe there.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":4418512,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651566,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 27, 2019\",\"review\":\"We just love Gardner and couldn\\u0027t have had a better experience.

When we walked in it felt different than other schools. It was clean, people were friendly and it felt HAPPY! There were happy children around everywhere. It was bright and colorful and pleasant to be in. We have had good teachers, met wonderful parents, and became very involved. The school has a great group of parents running the parent group that raises money all year for the programs that LAUSD doesn\\u0027t provide. PE, Music, Art, Yoga and Edible Gardening are all only provided because the parents raise the money. And it\\u0027s not a crazy amount. They aren\\u0027t hounding you for money. It\\u0027s usually through fun events like carnivals or dances. They encourage a monthly donation of as little as 5-10 dollars a month and it\\u0027s totally doable and worth it for what the kids get in the end. Parents don\\u0027t realize that other public schools don\\u0027t offer those programs. But Gardner students are thriving thanks to them. We believe in public schools. And LAUSD has a pretty rough reputation, but this is one of those schools that\\u0027s a diamond in the rough. It is diverse both racially and economically. It\\u0027s has three main languages spoken among students. It has loving and respectful teachers and administration.

This is truly a student-centered school, where the children are given the gift of becoming life long learners. The reader\\u0027s and writer\\u0027s workshops are opportunities for children to progress at his or her own rate. My child started off the year almost reading, and now she is on level E (at grade level) and we still have two months left of school. She is also writing on her own. Due to Principal Rosner\\u0027s openness and willingness to collaborate, many parents have been able to be involved in our school. Specifically in our class, parents have been able to volunteer in weekly art classes, lead nutrition lessons (a parent is a nutritionist and designed a workshop with fresh, healthy foods for kids that coincided with the letters of the alphabet they were learning), reading groups in class, chaperoning field trips etc. The high level of parent engagement makes this school very special. The art studio, physical education, and gardening programs are funded entirely by the parent group, Friends of Gardner. These programs enrich the curriculum, and are so beloved by the students. The open house and art show last week was a clear example of the success of the school. As a parent volunteer, I was able to witness the behind the scenes action of the flurry of art teachers and other volunteer parents working hard to display the well designed art installations before the bell hit 3:00. The principal worked alongside the parents, hanging art and maintaining his calm and upbeat demeanor even under the pressure of the clock. The event came together beautifully and I was so proud to be a member of the Gardner community. Students were so happy to have their families at school; the afternoon of student musicians, vibrant artwork, yummy fresh fruits from the garden, and an impressive classroom where student work was proudly displayed was a highlight of the year.

We chose our home elementary school over local charters\u002Fmagnets.The reason the school\\u0027s score dropped from an 8 to a 6 is based on last year\\u0027s Common Core tests even though the California Board of Education suspended the state’s school accountability system. Moreover, the Board of Education voted not to produce an Academic Performance Index (API) for the 2014-15 SY (the index uses student results to rank schools and to identify those that need improvement). Many educational professionals strongly believe current testing measures affluence rather than learning. Gardner is a Title 1 school with 50% of its children receiving free\u002Freduced lunch. This creates a socioeconomic and racially diverse school. However, this also means 30% of the students are learning English as a 2nd language and many students have limited access to computers\u002FI-pads compared to counterparts at surrounding schools. This is an important fact as last year\\u0027s test were electronic instead of the paper and pencil method used previously. Unfortunately, in light of these facts, Great Schools chose to adjust Gardner\\u0027s ranking based on last year\\u0027s test scores.Our principal (former vice principal at Wonderland rated a 10) has made positive changes to ensure each teacher at every grade level is exceptional. Teachers are well versed in traditional \\u0026 modern teaching methods. Ample training is provided to teachers to ensure they create a healthy learning environment and one that supports each child to grow emotionally. The children receive P.E. twice a week, music once a week, art once a week and enrichment courses that are provided on a rotational basis such as drama and garden. Additionally, enrichment classes are offered after school such as engineering and robotics. The children at Gardner are wonderful and kind. The landscaping\u002Fbuilding structure provides a beautiful background for learning. The teachers are a perfect blend of loving and strict. Both children and teachers are taught principles of talking circles or peacemaking circles. These circles use a structural framework to build relationships and to address conflict within a community. This in turn creates an environment where children play well together. Lastly, the parents are lovely! They are friendly and involved in making our school wonderful.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":1805342,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651535,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Oct 13, 2015\",\"review\":\"The grade dropped from 8 to 6 for this school.

Several times I had concerns and he was either available for an unplanned meeting (the door is almost always open to parents) or I was able to make an appointment to see him later. It is clear he is making changes and implementing new programs at the school. Some people always get upset by change, but I have seen positive results and believe that for every negative person upset by the changes there are many more who are looking forward to what\\u0027s next.

The aid they recommended had him in time out on a chair in the corner of a room, with a stopwatch which she restarted every time he moved his legs or talked. The rest of the class were staring at him. The school were in support of this. I have yet to meet a therapist who described this as less than \\u0027borderline abuse\\u0027.

I can say with complete honesty and sincerity that 98% of the staff at TIOH are very highly invested in meeting the needs of the students, above all else. They care a great deal about children and how they impact their lives. Like most teachers, they sure aren\\u0027t doing it to get rich. If you take a tour, talk to other parents. They have no reason to lie or exaggerate. During my tenure at TIOH, values, citizenship, fairness, and responsibility were recurring, prioritized themes when mapping out the year. As for the parent with the special needs child who was disappointed or offended by her experience, I won\\u0027t pretend to know the administration\\u0027s reason for wanting that conversation to be private, but it\\u0027s certainly not because the school turns away special needs kids. The school has had deaf students, a student with dwarfism, a downs syndrome student, countless students with processing issues, Aspergers, Anxiety and OCD issues, language problems, and more. The reality is that special needs can take 100 different forms and it would be irresponsible for an administrator to public agree that a shadow for the child is sufficient for the child to succeed in the school\\u0027s environment.

Since enrolling here he has thrived! HSH has supported my child in becoming a confident, compassionate, and curious citizen. HSH embodies all the reasons why I felt it necessary for him to be in an independent school:1. Small Class Size It was important that my son be in an environment that was not overwhelming in size. At HSH he has the opportunity to create friendships with all of his classmates2. Individualized AttentionTeachers know my son and are able to assess\u002Faddress his needs, if any. They do an excellent job of communicating with parents and are always available to meet. The school uses Kaymbu which allows parents to view photos\u002Fvideos of their child’s school day. Teachers at HSH are aware of what each child is doing. 3. DiversityIf my son attended his local public school he would have been the only child of his ethnicity there. At HSH diversity comes in many forms: male faculty is represented in the lower elementary school and in the pre-school; my son is able to interact with families from different countries; ethnic diversity is represented in the student body and in staff; and the school’s commitment to socio-economic diversity is reflected in their generous financial aid policy. 4. Caring CommunityAt HSH, every staff member from the Head of School to the Cafeteria Manager knows my son. He knows he is cared for and feels comfortable and safe expressing his thoughts and feelings. Nowhere is this more evident than in the new Head of School. Ms. Ilse’s warm personality is instantly felt by those around her. She opens humbly to advice on how to improve the school and most importantly she is approachable. Her enthusiasm towards educating children trickles down to all staff members.5.Progressive CurriculumIt was important that my son not be taught to simply pass a test. HSH has a well balanced mix of both traditional and progressive curriculum that challenges children but also comes with supports in place to meet them where they are at. They are big on project based learning and my son comes home excited each day to share what he is working onAs one can tell from this lengthy review I am a proud HSH parent.

Checking web sites, listening to other parents and trusted friends, can offer great insight. But the best way to pick the right school for your needs is to see the school, meet the teachers and the people who run it. At the Schoolhouse we offer families an opportunity to become part of our family. We have been in the business of educating children since 1945. We have grown up in the diverse community of Hollywood and we cherish it. We are not like other schools. We are a community based school that provides challenging academics in a non-traditional format. But also, we believe in the Hidden Curriculum, the stuff that children learn beyond the books. This is as important to us as the academics. When the children end their journey at the Schoolhouse, they are educated not only in the academic standards but about life and how to be a active member and a contributor to the world at large.

We had issues with bullies at this school, and virtually nothing was done about it. There was talk of putting policies in place, but no action. Another reason to stay away from this school: 8 students in 7th grade left HSH en masse to attend another school to finish out 8th grade.

Last year, when we were preparing for our move from NYC to LA, we checked out the Great Schools website regarding the three schools to which we had applied. Once we received our acceptances, I went back and studied the parent comments again. Honestly, they only served to confuse me. Ultimately we chose The Hollywood Schoolhouse for our second grader. We liked the school immediately but I felt it was necessary to wait until the end of the school year to write an objective review. Here is why we are happy with HSH: Their curriculum is very well thought out. As the year progresses, they review and reinforce concepts so your child grows comfortable and confident. The way they teach subjects is fun for the kids, and why shouldn\\u0027t it be? For example, they just finished a project about a historical figure of their choice that included a biographical essay, an art project, and a performance. My child learned more than I ever anticipated and had a great time doing it. That\\u0027s just one example, it has been a year of great experiences. The parents are friendly, the school has a good vibe, and the administration listens when you have a problem. Yes, they ask you to volunteer and donate money, but every school, public and private, asks that of parents--they have to. The Head of School, Mr. Stephen, works very hard to make HSH great and is always looking for ways to improve it. My child is excelling academically and is very, very happy. No school is a perfect fit for everyone, but HSH works for us.

From clubs, to leadership class, to dance and theatre shows, to great master classes and field trips- she got to do more in Middle school than one might expect in a public school setting. She also took foreign language and visual arts as well as her performing arts classes (dance, music and theatre.). The majority of teachers and staff are at the top of their game and truly care about the student experience at the school. The majority of classes she had showed good academic rigor and expectations for students. The complaints she expressed more than a few times included frustration about the work ethic of the students (not teachers) in some of her classes and the fact that the school could do more to reward all the students that do all the right things instead of pointing focus on poor choices made by some.

As adults, we must know how to resolve conflicts and set good examples for our children and I can imagine that teachers do the same. If you speak in a demeaning way and out of rage about the place where you work and your boss, you always have choices. Go work somewhere else!! Your students do not deserve such bitterness.

As we were touring all the private schools in the area, we decided to stop by the Open House at our zoned public school, Gardner - just to see for ourselves how much worse it would be. We were shocked to find that we loved everything about Gardner! The way it looks and feels (happy! Filled with art, music and laughter), and mostly its progressive mindset. We were so shaken up that we went back two more times to confirm that our initial impression was not skewed in some way... Our son is now a thriving 2nd grader at Gardner, and we truly do love this school.Gardner Street Elementary is a neighborhood gem with an engaged principal, excellent teachers and helpful staff, and a small but very active parent body that makes things happen. Many students live outside the school zone but they and their parents like Gardner so much that they\\u0027ve chosen to permit in.What makes Gardner so special are its diverse staff and students, family-like atmosphere, and the many \\\"extras\\\". Thanks to annual fundraisers coupled with lots of fun events for kids and families throughout the school year, \\\"non-essential\\\" classes that are not paid for by LAUSD and not offered in many public schools - such as Visual Art, Music, PE, Yoga, Organic Edible Garden, and (new!) Science Lab - are part of the everyday curriculum and available to every child at Gardner. There are many really great afterschool programs to choose from, and occasional workshops for parents\u002Fcaregivers. Campus beautification is ongoing.Besides all the fun, there is serious learning going on as well. Learning to truly *understand* and not just memorize to ace tests. So much learning goes on at school that - as supported by countless studies and best-performing schools in Finland - there are no homework requirements for the younger kids.Most importantly, my child has developed love for reading and learning, he is excited about going to school every day, and he feels safe there.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":4418512,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651566,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 27, 2019\",\"review\":\"We just love Gardner and couldn\\u0027t have had a better experience.

The school has a great group of parents running the parent group that raises money all year for the programs that LAUSD doesn\\u0027t provide. PE, Music, Art, Yoga and Edible Gardening are all only provided because the parents raise the money. And it\\u0027s not a crazy amount. They aren\\u0027t hounding you for money. It\\u0027s usually through fun events like carnivals or dances. They encourage a monthly donation of as little as 5-10 dollars a month and it\\u0027s totally doable and worth it for what the kids get in the end. Parents don\\u0027t realize that other public schools don\\u0027t offer those programs. But Gardner students are thriving thanks to them. We believe in public schools. And LAUSD has a pretty rough reputation, but this is one of those schools that\\u0027s a diamond in the rough. It is diverse both racially and economically.

My child started off the year almost reading, and now she is on level E (at grade level) and we still have two months left of school. She is also writing on her own. Due to Principal Rosner\\u0027s openness and willingness to collaborate, many parents have been able to be involved in our school. Specifically in our class, parents have been able to volunteer in weekly art classes, lead nutrition lessons (a parent is a nutritionist and designed a workshop with fresh, healthy foods for kids that coincided with the letters of the alphabet they were learning), reading groups in class, chaperoning field trips etc. The high level of parent engagement makes this school very special. The art studio, physical education, and gardening programs are funded entirely by the parent group, Friends of Gardner. These programs enrich the curriculum, and are so beloved by the students. The open house and art show last week was a clear example of the success of the school. As a parent volunteer, I was able to witness the behind the scenes action of the flurry of art teachers and other volunteer parents working hard to display the well designed art installations before the bell hit 3:00. The principal worked alongside the parents, hanging art and maintaining his calm and upbeat demeanor even under the pressure of the clock. The event came together beautifully and I was so proud to be a member of the Gardner community. Students were so happy to have their families at school; the afternoon of student musicians, vibrant artwork, yummy fresh fruits from the garden, and an impressive classroom where student work was proudly displayed was a highlight of the year.

We chose our home elementary school over local charters\u002Fmagnets.The reason the school\\u0027s score dropped from an 8 to a 6 is based on last year\\u0027s Common Core tests even though the California Board of Education suspended the state’s school accountability system. Moreover, the Board of Education voted not to produce an Academic Performance Index (API) for the 2014-15 SY (the index uses student results to rank schools and to identify those that need improvement). Many educational professionals strongly believe current testing measures affluence rather than learning. Gardner is a Title 1 school with 50% of its children receiving free\u002Freduced lunch. This creates a socioeconomic and racially diverse school. However, this also means 30% of the students are learning English as a 2nd language and many students have limited access to computers\u002FI-pads compared to counterparts at surrounding schools. This is an important fact as last year\\u0027s test were electronic instead of the paper and pencil method used previously. Unfortunately, in light of these facts, Great Schools chose to adjust Gardner\\u0027s ranking based on last year\\u0027s test scores.Our principal (former vice principal at Wonderland rated a 10) has made positive changes to ensure each teacher at every grade level is exceptional. Teachers are well versed in traditional \\u0026 modern teaching methods. Ample training is provided to teachers to ensure they create a healthy learning environment and one that supports each child to grow emotionally. The children receive P.E. twice a week, music once a week, art once a week and enrichment courses that are provided on a rotational basis such as drama and garden. Additionally, enrichment classes are offered after school such as engineering and robotics. The children at Gardner are wonderful and kind. The landscaping\u002Fbuilding structure provides a beautiful background for learning. The teachers are a perfect blend of loving and strict. Both children and teachers are taught principles of talking circles or peacemaking circles. These circles use a structural framework to build relationships and to address conflict within a community. This in turn creates an environment where children play well together. Lastly, the parents are lovely!

The stakeholders at Gardner work hard to implement additional educational programs. They have funded a music program, a physical education program, computer lab, gardening class, and an art lab. The teachers and staff members are constantly working together. We share ideas, acitivities, and collaborate on our lesson plans. Most of the faculty puts countless of unpaid hours to develop the curriculum for their students and well being of the school. We do this with love, passion, and dedication. The parents and families at the school are amazing. My classroom parents are always there to volunteer in the classroom, help fix my computers, assist in art lab, volunteer in the PTA, the list goes on!

If I understand correctly he has navigated 2 other schools from average to accelerated. All the teachers we have encountered have something positive to offer students BEYOND the rising test score achievement. Many of which utilize the grand resources here in LA. The Geffen Playhouse, LA Opera, and the Environmental Outdoor Program (exact name?), to name a few. They are adding music enrichment programs right now.

The majority of teachers and staff are at the top of their game and truly care about the student experience at the school. The majority of classes she had showed good academic rigor and expectations for students. The complaints she expressed more than a few times included frustration about the work ethic of the students (not teachers) in some of her classes and the fact that the school could do more to reward all the students that do all the right things instead of pointing focus on poor choices made by some.

But, it is not just teachers, its the counselors, administration, and the district who need to invest on giving students the right tools.

Only a few of the students care and those students are deprived and striped out of having a the right level of education. Having students wear uniforms, and more authority over these students is not the solution to bigger issues here. Parents and students have to take charge and demand better educational services and teachers, counselors, and the administrators have to work together to meet goals.

There may be a lot of homework given at the school, but all of the students have a sufficient amount of time to complete it. The school runs on what is called a \\\"block-schedule.\\\" This means that students attend all 6 classes on Monday, 1-3 periods on Tuesday and Thursday, and 4-6 periods on Wednesday and Friday. It is the student\\u0027s responsibility to manage their time properly. As an alumni of the cheer team, I don\\u0027t believe that all of the cheerleaders act like mean girls. I agree that a whole group of cheerleaders can be perceived as intimidating (all thanks to stereotypes) but these assumptions are false. Stereotypes say that cheerleaders are selfish and stupid. Majority of the cheerleaders have high GPAs and take AP and Honors classes. Class of 2013\\u0027s top 3 students consisted of 2 cheerleaders. A lot of the cheerleaders participate in volunteer work and ASB as well. Ms. Angelica is AMAZING.

As we were touring all the private schools in the area, we decided to stop by the Open House at our zoned public school, Gardner - just to see for ourselves how much worse it would be. We were shocked to find that we loved everything about Gardner! The way it looks and feels (happy! Filled with art, music and laughter), and mostly its progressive mindset. We were so shaken up that we went back two more times to confirm that our initial impression was not skewed in some way... Our son is now a thriving 2nd grader at Gardner, and we truly do love this school.Gardner Street Elementary is a neighborhood gem with an engaged principal, excellent teachers and helpful staff, and a small but very active parent body that makes things happen. Many students live outside the school zone but they and their parents like Gardner so much that they\\u0027ve chosen to permit in.What makes Gardner so special are its diverse staff and students, family-like atmosphere, and the many \\\"extras\\\". Thanks to annual fundraisers coupled with lots of fun events for kids and families throughout the school year, \\\"non-essential\\\" classes that are not paid for by LAUSD and not offered in many public schools - such as Visual Art, Music, PE, Yoga, Organic Edible Garden, and (new!) Science Lab - are part of the everyday curriculum and available to every child at Gardner. There are many really great afterschool programs to choose from, and occasional workshops for parents\u002Fcaregivers. Campus beautification is ongoing.Besides all the fun, there is serious learning going on as well. Learning to truly *understand* and not just memorize to ace tests. So much learning goes on at school that - as supported by countless studies and best-performing schools in Finland - there are no homework requirements for the younger kids.Most importantly, my child has developed love for reading and learning, he is excited about going to school every day, and he feels safe there.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":4418512,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651566,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 27, 2019\",\"review\":\"We just love Gardner and couldn\\u0027t have had a better experience.

This is truly a student-centered school, where the children are given the gift of becoming life long learners. The reader\\u0027s and writer\\u0027s workshops are opportunities for children to progress at his or her own rate. My child started off the year almost reading, and now she is on level E (at grade level) and we still have two months left of school. She is also writing on her own. Due to Principal Rosner\\u0027s openness and willingness to collaborate, many parents have been able to be involved in our school. Specifically in our class, parents have been able to volunteer in weekly art classes, lead nutrition lessons (a parent is a nutritionist and designed a workshop with fresh, healthy foods for kids that coincided with the letters of the alphabet they were learning), reading groups in class, chaperoning field trips etc. The high level of parent engagement makes this school very special. The art studio, physical education, and gardening programs are funded entirely by the parent group, Friends of Gardner. These programs enrich the curriculum, and are so beloved by the students. The open house and art show last week was a clear example of the success of the school. As a parent volunteer, I was able to witness the behind the scenes action of the flurry of art teachers and other volunteer parents working hard to display the well designed art installations before the bell hit 3:00. The principal worked alongside the parents, hanging art and maintaining his calm and upbeat demeanor even under the pressure of the clock. The event came together beautifully and I was so proud to be a member of the Gardner community. Students were so happy to have their families at school; the afternoon of student musicians, vibrant artwork, yummy fresh fruits from the garden, and an impressive classroom where student work was proudly displayed was a highlight of the year. I can\\u0027t describe the amount of joy that goes on in this gem of a school!

We chose our home elementary school over local charters\u002Fmagnets.The reason the school\\u0027s score dropped from an 8 to a 6 is based on last year\\u0027s Common Core tests even though the California Board of Education suspended the state’s school accountability system. Moreover, the Board of Education voted not to produce an Academic Performance Index (API) for the 2014-15 SY (the index uses student results to rank schools and to identify those that need improvement). Many educational professionals strongly believe current testing measures affluence rather than learning. Gardner is a Title 1 school with 50% of its children receiving free\u002Freduced lunch. This creates a socioeconomic and racially diverse school. However, this also means 30% of the students are learning English as a 2nd language and many students have limited access to computers\u002FI-pads compared to counterparts at surrounding schools. This is an important fact as last year\\u0027s test were electronic instead of the paper and pencil method used previously. Unfortunately, in light of these facts, Great Schools chose to adjust Gardner\\u0027s ranking based on last year\\u0027s test scores.Our principal (former vice principal at Wonderland rated a 10) has made positive changes to ensure each teacher at every grade level is exceptional. Teachers are well versed in traditional \\u0026 modern teaching methods. Ample training is provided to teachers to ensure they create a healthy learning environment and one that supports each child to grow emotionally. The children receive P.E. twice a week, music once a week, art once a week and enrichment courses that are provided on a rotational basis such as drama and garden. Additionally, enrichment classes are offered after school such as engineering and robotics. The children at Gardner are wonderful and kind. The landscaping\u002Fbuilding structure provides a beautiful background for learning. The teachers are a perfect blend of loving and strict. Both children and teachers are taught principles of talking circles or peacemaking circles. These circles use a structural framework to build relationships and to address conflict within a community. This in turn creates an environment where children play well together. Lastly, the parents are lovely!

He is charismatic, seems to love his job, and from my point of view he is working to elevate this school to the VERY HIGHEST LEVELS. He is engaging with parents, students and staff, and supports creative efforts by all. He brings a wealth of experience to this school both as a former educator and a leader. If I understand correctly he has navigated 2 other schools from average to accelerated. All the teachers we have encountered have something positive to offer students BEYOND the rising test score achievement. Many of which utilize the grand resources here in LA. The Geffen Playhouse, LA Opera, and the Environmental Outdoor Program (exact name?), to name a few. They are adding music enrichment programs right now. The parents are becoming very active in support of this school which will bring even more enrichment programs and teacher support.

From clubs, to leadership class, to dance and theatre shows, to great master classes and field trips- she got to do more in Middle school than one might expect in a public school setting. She also took foreign language and visual arts as well as her performing arts classes (dance, music and theatre.). The majority of teachers and staff are at the top of their game and truly care about the student experience at the school. The majority of classes she had showed good academic rigor and expectations for students. The complaints she expressed more than a few times included frustration about the work ethic of the students (not teachers) in some of her classes and the fact that the school could do more to reward all the students that do all the right things instead of pointing focus on poor choices made by some.

If you speak in a demeaning way and out of rage about the place where you work and your boss, you always have choices. Go work somewhere else!! Your students do not deserve such bitterness. Think about students first, and always.
