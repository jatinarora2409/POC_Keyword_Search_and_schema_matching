I have twins and each year we have been able to experience both teachers at each grade level up to fourth grade. Every teacher is unique and engaged with the kids. We do an annual arts calendar with quotes from the children regarding how they feel about art. The quotes are incredible. This school is one of a kind!! The rating should be higher.

Rachel used the phrase \\u0027special needs\\u0027. The aid they recommended had him in time out on a chair in the corner of a room, with a stopwatch which she restarted every time he moved his legs or talked. The rest of the class were staring at him. The school were in support of this. I have yet to meet a therapist who described this as less than \\u0027borderline abuse\\u0027. When we asked to bring in a developmental aid instead who could actively help him, Rachel said \\u0027we\\u0027re not a special needs school.\\u0027 My son\\u0027s teacher said, in front of my son and classmates, \\u0027you shouldn\\u0027t bring him to the Thanksgiving show, kids with special needs don\\u0027t do well at these things.\\u0027 He was sent to the principal\\u0027s office \\u0027for a chat\\u0027 regularly.

He was traumatized and ashamed by his daily school life. He is now thriving at his new school (without an aid or any kind of extra therapy). I ran into his old occupational therapist who I love.

I can say with complete honesty and sincerity that 98% of the staff at TIOH are very highly invested in meeting the needs of the students, above all else. They care a great deal about children and how they impact their lives. Like most teachers, they sure aren\\u0027t doing it to get rich. If you take a tour, talk to other parents. They have no reason to lie or exaggerate. During my tenure at TIOH, values, citizenship, fairness, and responsibility were recurring, prioritized themes when mapping out the year. As for the parent with the special needs child who was disappointed or offended by her experience, I won\\u0027t pretend to know the administration\\u0027s reason for wanting that conversation to be private, but it\\u0027s certainly not because the school turns away special needs kids. The school has had deaf students, a student with dwarfism, a downs syndrome student, countless students with processing issues, Aspergers, Anxiety and OCD issues, language problems, and more. The reality is that special needs can take 100 different forms and it would be irresponsible for an administrator to public agree that a shadow for the child is sufficient for the child to succeed in the school\\u0027s environment. The school isn\\u0027t set up to necessarily provide the necessary resources for any kind of special needs kid that comes along. That\\u0027s probably why the administrator preferred a private conversation on the matter. Any kind of attitude, rudeness, etc. I can\\u0027t defend without being witness, but I can say with confidence that the staff as a rule is very professional, considerate, and emotionally invested in doing their best for parents and students.\",\"reviewerRating\":4,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":620260,\"maponicsId\":2335533,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F20260-Temple-Israel-Of-Hollywood-Day-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16694306,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Jul 13, 2015\",\"review\":\"Unless your local public school is terrible and there is no better private option then you should consider this school.

As we were touring all the private schools in the area, we decided to stop by the Open House at our zoned public school, Gardner - just to see for ourselves how much worse it would be. We were shocked to find that we loved everything about Gardner! The way it looks and feels (happy! Filled with art, music and laughter), and mostly its progressive mindset. We were so shaken up that we went back two more times to confirm that our initial impression was not skewed in some way... Our son is now a thriving 2nd grader at Gardner, and we truly do love this school.Gardner Street Elementary is a neighborhood gem with an engaged principal, excellent teachers and helpful staff, and a small but very active parent body that makes things happen. Many students live outside the school zone but they and their parents like Gardner so much that they\\u0027ve chosen to permit in.What makes Gardner so special are its diverse staff and students, family-like atmosphere, and the many \\\"extras\\\". Thanks to annual fundraisers coupled with lots of fun events for kids and families throughout the school year, \\\"non-essential\\\" classes that are not paid for by LAUSD and not offered in many public schools - such as Visual Art, Music, PE, Yoga, Organic Edible Garden, and (new!) Science Lab - are part of the everyday curriculum and available to every child at Gardner. There are many really great afterschool programs to choose from, and occasional workshops for parents\u002Fcaregivers. Campus beautification is ongoing.Besides all the fun, there is serious learning going on as well. Learning to truly *understand* and not just memorize to ace tests. So much learning goes on at school that - as supported by countless studies and best-performing schools in Finland - there are no homework requirements for the younger kids.Most importantly, my child has developed love for reading and learning, he is excited about going to school every day, and he feels safe there.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":4418512,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651566,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 27, 2019\",\"review\":\"We just love Gardner and couldn\\u0027t have had a better experience.

My child started off the year almost reading, and now she is on level E (at grade level) and we still have two months left of school. She is also writing on her own. Due to Principal Rosner\\u0027s openness and willingness to collaborate, many parents have been able to be involved in our school. Specifically in our class, parents have been able to volunteer in weekly art classes, lead nutrition lessons (a parent is a nutritionist and designed a workshop with fresh, healthy foods for kids that coincided with the letters of the alphabet they were learning), reading groups in class, chaperoning field trips etc. The high level of parent engagement makes this school very special. The art studio, physical education, and gardening programs are funded entirely by the parent group, Friends of Gardner. These programs enrich the curriculum, and are so beloved by the students. The open house and art show last week was a clear example of the success of the school.

We chose our home elementary school over local charters\u002Fmagnets.The reason the school\\u0027s score dropped from an 8 to a 6 is based on last year\\u0027s Common Core tests even though the California Board of Education suspended the state’s school accountability system. Moreover, the Board of Education voted not to produce an Academic Performance Index (API) for the 2014-15 SY (the index uses student results to rank schools and to identify those that need improvement). Many educational professionals strongly believe current testing measures affluence rather than learning. Gardner is a Title 1 school with 50% of its children receiving free\u002Freduced lunch. This creates a socioeconomic and racially diverse school. However, this also means 30% of the students are learning English as a 2nd language and many students have limited access to computers\u002FI-pads compared to counterparts at surrounding schools. This is an important fact as last year\\u0027s test were electronic instead of the paper and pencil method used previously. Unfortunately, in light of these facts, Great Schools chose to adjust Gardner\\u0027s ranking based on last year\\u0027s test scores.Our principal (former vice principal at Wonderland rated a 10) has made positive changes to ensure each teacher at every grade level is exceptional. Teachers are well versed in traditional \\u0026 modern teaching methods. Ample training is provided to teachers to ensure they create a healthy learning environment and one that supports each child to grow emotionally. The children receive P.E. twice a week, music once a week, art once a week and enrichment courses that are provided on a rotational basis such as drama and garden. Additionally, enrichment classes are offered after school such as engineering and robotics. The children at Gardner are wonderful and kind. The landscaping\u002Fbuilding structure provides a beautiful background for learning. The teachers are a perfect blend of loving and strict. Both children and teachers are taught principles of talking circles or peacemaking circles. These circles use a structural framework to build relationships and to address conflict within a community. This in turn creates an environment where children play well together. Lastly, the parents are lovely! They are friendly and involved in making our school wonderful.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":1805342,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651535,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Oct 13, 2015\",\"review\":\"The grade dropped from 8 to 6 for this school.

Are these children receiving the best education they claim to have or are they teaching the children the minimal standard? The heart of the school comes from the teachers and not the school director Mrs Yolanda Brown. She needs to stop putting herself into other people\\u0027s business and let the Principle and teachers run the school. I am wondering should I take my two kids out of this school and send them to another school. That is my only option unless Mrs Yolanda Brown changes her character or have herself replaced by another Director. This school is falling into the abyss and unless we the parents come together and voice our concerns, she will run the school down and our children will lose more than just an education, The school will lose the support of the community that give to the church and school. She tends to show her disrespect among Latinos more than the other families in Blessed Sacrament school. This is not the person who said that she follows Gods path but rather the oposite.

DO NOT enroll your child in this school under any circumstance.

The fact is, that because SHE looked for things to be involved with and took advantage of all kinds of opportunities, she had a great middle school experience. From clubs, to leadership class, to dance and theatre shows, to great master classes and field trips- she got to do more in Middle school than one might expect in a public school setting. She also took foreign language and visual arts as well as her performing arts classes (dance, music and theatre.). The majority of teachers and staff are at the top of their game and truly care about the student experience at the school. The majority of classes she had showed good academic rigor and expectations for students. The complaints she expressed more than a few times included frustration about the work ethic of the students (not teachers) in some of her classes and the fact that the school could do more to reward all the students that do all the right things instead of pointing focus on poor choices made by some.

I was a student attending Aspire Pacific Academy, and the attention that they gave me was all that i needed. I am a Magna ---- Laude student and the teachers would do anything to help out their students. This school does prepare you for college. Although i had only been in this school for Freshman year, i had a great experience. My two older sisters (both are twins) had been in this school from the start, they just graduated this year in 2013 and they had been accepted in two wonderful colleges. On went to UC Merced and the other in the Art Institute . As, an old student, i do recommend to send your children here, this school mostly treat you like family because of its small size. Unfortunately, i am not able to attend this school no more due to how far i live from this school, finding a school like this is hard.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":625423,\"maponicsId\":1371003,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fhuntington-park\u002F25423-Aspire-Pacific-Academy\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":5594743,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Nov 26, 2012\",\"review\":\"The school offers more support than its neighboring High Schools in the goal of succeeding in school and achieving the dream to enter College.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":625423,\"maponicsId\":1266367,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fhuntington-park\u002F25423-Aspire-Pacific-Academy\u002F\"}],\"schoolGranularRatings\":[{\"schoolId\":297465,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Equity\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"5\"},{\"schoolId\":334573,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"College Readiness\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"1\"},{\"schoolId\":297466,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Test Scores\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"5\"},{\"schoolId\":297468,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Academic Progress\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"5\"},{\"schoolId\":297464,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Low Income\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"5\"}],\"schoolDistrict\":{\"id\":9940,\"districtName\":\"Los Angeles Unified School District\",\"address\":\"333 South Beaudry Avenue\",\"city\":\"Los Angeles\",\"stateCode\":\"CA\",\"zip\":\"90017\",\"latitude\":34.0561,\"longitude\":-118.257,\"websiteUrl\":\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.lausd.net\",\"greatschoolDistrictOverviewUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002Flos-angeles-unified-school-district\u002F\"},\"greatschoolParentReviewsUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fhuntington-park\u002F25423-Aspire-Pacific-Academy\u002F#Reviews\",\"elementary\":false,\"middle\":true,\"high\":true,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Oct 8, 2020\"},{\"servesHome\":false,\"parentRating\":3,\"distanceInMiles\":\"14.0\",\"gradeRanges\":\"7 to 12\",\"institutionType\":\"Public\",\"name\":\"Dorothy V.

They gave a note to students saying they were \\\"very disappointed\\\" with the vendors..unacceptable for a school to allow that. On another note, the school really is solely academics.

From clubs, to leadership class, to dance and theatre shows, to great master classes and field trips- she got to do more in Middle school than one might expect in a public school setting. She also took foreign language and visual arts as well as her performing arts classes (dance, music and theatre.). The majority of teachers and staff are at the top of their game and truly care about the student experience at the school. The majority of classes she had showed good academic rigor and expectations for students. The complaints she expressed more than a few times included frustration about the work ethic of the students (not teachers) in some of her classes and the fact that the school could do more to reward all the students that do all the right things instead of pointing focus on poor choices made by some.
