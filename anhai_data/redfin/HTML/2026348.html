The leadership is top notch and all of the teachers are enthusiastic, young, well-trained, and eager to improve. I mean every single one of them. The school itself is beautiful and located in Pac Heights next to a half dozen or so private schools which is nice because it makes that area very kid aware and friendly. We even have a wonderful woman who volunteers from the neighborhood; pulling weeds, helping with the garden, interacting with the kids. Principal Keener makes everything work, it\\u0027s hard to imagine that the place was ever any other way. She\\u0027s created a very rich, loving, respectful culture that offers great comfort when you\\u0027re driving away from your little one. The Montessori method is also a great benefit, offering kids mobility and agency over their own learning. I like that the classes are of mixed age as it seems to inspire everyone to be more aware of each other\\u0027s needs. There\\u0027s a lot of natural mentorship happening on a daily basis. Spend a little time finding out more about Montessori.

I played both volleyball and basketball for six years and recommend joining a sports team. My high school application journey was successful, mostly because of how much Saint Brigid prepared me. When application time came around in eighth grade, I got into every high school I applied to. This includes two private schools (University and Bay), one catholic school (Sacred Heart Cathedral) and a public school (Lowell High School). I received a large scholarship from Bay and was accepted into Sacred Heart under the DePaul Program. Now, I attend Lowell, the top public school in the state.

My college age sophomores were well prepared for college with rigorous study and academics at SHCP. They were able to choose the extracurricular activities that interested them and became leaders in the areas of their interests. There is so much to be involved with at SHCP - theater, tech crew, speech and debate, sports, music, chorus, newspaper, magazine, service clubs, dance – there is literally something for everyone! The sense of community that is built at SHCP is really what makes it stand apart from all other high schools, in my opinion. From day one, staff and faculty make it clear that they are grateful to parents for “allowing” them to educate your child. The community that is built within each class starts at freshman orientation with a class dance and carnival, and ends with a senior grad night lock-in\u002Fdance\u002Fcarnival. Parents are welcomed at freshman orientation with a class Mass and BBQ. I always feel welcomed on campus and find the faculty easy to approach and available to parents.I think the biggest testament of the welcoming spirit and inclusiveness at SHC is that when my college age children are home from school, one of the first places they visit is SHCP. They created lasting bonds with so many of the faculty and staff. Teachers challenged their intellects, listened to them, directed them and cared for them.

Sherman is a school that is highly focused on academics (using the Columbia University, Reading \\u0026 Writing Workshop program) with plenty of enrichment and a large outdoor garden used to help support the kids learning. Leadership is key to getting this mix correct, and the Principal works hard to meet the needs of all the students. Pros: beautiful school, love the differentiated reading program, wonderful enrichment staff, amazing garden and seasoned teaching staff; Cons: start time (7:50 ugh), keeping up the garden takes a lot of parent volunteer work, also parent fundraising is heavy but it is necessary to keep the school running.

The school does not possess a healthy culture. In this school, studying is not important. Instead, the teacher constantly picks on childrens\\u0027 clothing, like the fashion police. The curriculum is weak compared to other schools we have experienced. The Principal does not have the necessary leadership. She does not respect parents and their opinion. Once you report anything that should be improved, your child or family may even get retaliated from the school. While most parents hoped that the Principal could solve the problems, it never happened here. While some of the staff are nice and friendly, under the current Principal, most things fall apart in this school. The priority of the school is so different compared to normal schools to the extent that you would not feel that it is like a school. For example, the book fair should be a learning event. Instead, it became an event to take little kids\\u0027 money. More things that disappointed us. Too bad to mention here.

25, 2019\",\"review\":\"There hasn\\u0027t been a review posted for Rosa Parks a while, so I figured I\\u0027d write a long one. My son has been at Rosa Parks for three years now, and I am getting ready to to send my daughter to kindergarten there. We\\u0027ve tried both the Gen Ed (now with a science\u002Ftechnology focus!) and Japanese programs and are very happy with teachers and school culture in both. The ongoing struggle, as seen in the numbers above, is closing the gap in outcomes between kids from high-income and low-income families. My 2¢ as a parent who has watched two principals and teachers in two programs across three grades, is that the school community as a whole is committed to helping not just kids but families through the big changes shaking up neighborhoods: rising rents, evictions, and the departure of many middle-class families who just can\\u0027t afford the city anymore. The good news is that Rosa Parks has a lot of energetic and engaged parents from all walks of life, and remains deeply connected to both Japanese-American and African-American civil rights movements. Yes, there are two programs, but the school feels unified. The entire school starts the day together in physical activity (alternating Japanese calisthetics and the Cha-Cha Slide), then kids get mixed into combined small groups for reading practice. All the kids spend lots of time with a garden teacher, with the plants and chickens as the basis for science lessons and weekly salad lunches. All the kids see performances at nearby Civic Center arts organizations. All the kids do engineering and science projects in the new hands-on learning studio. (As an aside, the school has a partnership with Boys and Girls Club, which means that my son spends his afternoons getting music lessons and homework help at the clubhouse on Fulton and Gough -- it\\u0027s the best deal in SF.) Rosa Parks is, as other parents have said, a hidden gem in the heart of San Francisco.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606420,\"maponicsId\":3827582,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6420-Parks-Rosa-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665238,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Nov 18, 2015\",\"review\":\"Rosa Parks is a hidden gem!

In my opinion, Redding has many different communities rather than one tight-knit one which is such a pity as, in appearance, it\\u0027s clearly very diverse but, like the colors of the rainbow, they remain separate from one another. Much needs to be done to bring the many groups together in the hope that there can be more understanding, acceptance, tolerance, inclusiveness and to inevitably create a more harmonious environment for all.Yes, bullying does occur as with every school but instances do seem to be increasing mainly due to the fact that not much, if anything at all, is done to tackle it. The children are called into to the office for a little chat and swiftly sent back to class... Next!The principal is extremely dedicated and she and her team work incredibly hard to run the school as smoothly as possible, however, she is at times struggling to interact with the many different groups that make up the Redding community in a more impactful and relatable level.All that said, the teachers from TK all the way through to 5th Grade are just pure class and the saving grace.

Unbelievable. I felt comforted when he started that they keep all of the sixth graders separate, and make them take an intro course to each elective so that when they return as seventh graders they know what they enjoyed most and can spend a full year focused on it.

On the positive side, most teachers were deeply committed to the kids and were extremely skilled, almost heroic, instructors. Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell.

Also, they will not tolerate bullying, they are very strict. I highly recommend this high school. JROTC program is my favorite, and both of my kids are in it, you will learn discipline, respect, structure, how to work as a team, and military drills. The program staff will help you if your child wants to get into the military as well !!!This is the only high school that has a JROTC that is for the “Navy” ( other SF High Sch. are army\u002Fmarines)There is so much to say about this program but not enough time.

25, 2019\",\"review\":\"There hasn\\u0027t been a review posted for Rosa Parks a while, so I figured I\\u0027d write a long one. My son has been at Rosa Parks for three years now, and I am getting ready to to send my daughter to kindergarten there. We\\u0027ve tried both the Gen Ed (now with a science\u002Ftechnology focus!) and Japanese programs and are very happy with teachers and school culture in both. The ongoing struggle, as seen in the numbers above, is closing the gap in outcomes between kids from high-income and low-income families. My 2¢ as a parent who has watched two principals and teachers in two programs across three grades, is that the school community as a whole is committed to helping not just kids but families through the big changes shaking up neighborhoods: rising rents, evictions, and the departure of many middle-class families who just can\\u0027t afford the city anymore. The good news is that Rosa Parks has a lot of energetic and engaged parents from all walks of life, and remains deeply connected to both Japanese-American and African-American civil rights movements. Yes, there are two programs, but the school feels unified. The entire school starts the day together in physical activity (alternating Japanese calisthetics and the Cha-Cha Slide), then kids get mixed into combined small groups for reading practice. All the kids spend lots of time with a garden teacher, with the plants and chickens as the basis for science lessons and weekly salad lunches. All the kids see performances at nearby Civic Center arts organizations. All the kids do engineering and science projects in the new hands-on learning studio. (As an aside, the school has a partnership with Boys and Girls Club, which means that my son spends his afternoons getting music lessons and homework help at the clubhouse on Fulton and Gough -- it\\u0027s the best deal in SF.) Rosa Parks is, as other parents have said, a hidden gem in the heart of San Francisco.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606420,\"maponicsId\":3827582,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6420-Parks-Rosa-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665238,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Nov 18, 2015\",\"review\":\"Rosa Parks is a hidden gem!

Instead they knock the Principal and try to hurt the reputation of a school that has an API of 931!

Within months my perfectly normal child became depressed. I had no idea how bad the environment was until I came to speak to a teacher. For three weeks this teacher was unable to tell me what assignment my daughter missed when she was sick. Once I entered the school, I understood my daughter\\u0027s desperation and also why this teacher could not perform her job. While I was waiting at the secretary\\u0027s window, a girl was yelling obscenities down the hall, words one would usually only hear from a mentally ill homeless person. It didn\\u0027t seem to create too much stir, even though there were teachers around, as if this was within the norm. Then I went to my daughter\\u0027s class, it was an absolute chaos.

Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

Here are my impression FWIW. Mission class sizes are as low as 18 students, Lowell as high as 40+. Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t. Mission wins on architecture, weather, transportation, location and student to faculty ratio. Lowell wins on academic reputation and performance. Both campuses are equally safe with dedicated staff, though Mission\\u0027s makes more of an effort with more to prove.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":1133732,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":14535080,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Mar 6, 2011\",\"review\":\"i love mission lets go bears go mission is the best decision u could ever make there are the best teachers u can learn really quick the teachers are always pushing u to always do ur best and be positive , peace and love, society ,fashion music and to love ur self and u learn who to develop ur skills and how to protect ursef mission high is not th BAD school as some people out there say\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":1068432,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"}],\"schoolGranularRatings\":[{\"schoolId\":289716,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Low Income\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289713,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Test Scores\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289712,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"College Readiness\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289715,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Equity\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"}],\"schoolDistrict\":{\"id\":14313,\"districtName\":\"San Francisco Unified School District\",\"address\":\"555 Franklin Street\",\"city\":\"San Francisco\",\"stateCode\":\"CA\",\"zip\":\"94102\",\"latitude\":37.7795,\"longitude\":-122.4219,\"websiteUrl\":\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.sfusd.edu\",\"greatschoolDistrictOverviewUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002Fsan-francisco-unified-school-district\u002F\"},\"greatschoolParentReviewsUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F#Reviews\",\"elementary\":false,\"middle\":false,\"high\":true,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 22, 2020\"}],\"totalSchoolsServiced\":0,\"sectionPreviewText\":\"Average rating 5.2 out of 10\",\"shouldHideSection\":false,\"hasChoiceDistricts\":true}}}","type":"application\u002Fjson","status":200,"statusType":2,"info":false,"ok":true,"clientError":false,"serverError":false,"error":false,"accepted":false,"noContent":false,"badRequest":false,"unauthorized":false,"notAcceptable":false,"notFound":false,"forbidden":false}});});</script><div data-react-server-root-id="25" data-react-server-timing-offset="660" onclick="__reactServerOnClickHandler.call(this, 25)"><div class="delayLoadedComponentWrapper pageComponentsContainer"><div class="dp-col-sm-12 dp-col-md-8"><section class="Section MainHouseInfoPanel"><div class="sectionContainer"><div class="house-info-container"><div class="house-info" data-rf-test-id="house-info" id="house-info"><div class="bhi" data-rf-test-id="mhi-housesummary"><div class="content clear-fix"><div class="remarks font-weight-roman"><div class="expandableSection collapsed expandablePreview marketingRemarks" data-rf-test-id="listingRemarks" id="marketingRemarks-preview"><div aria-hidden="true" class="sectionContentContainer" style="max-height:70px;-webkit-transition-duration:0s;transition-duration:0s"><div class="sectionContent"><div class="remarks" data-rf-test-id="listingRemarks" id="marketing-remarks-scroll"><p class="text-base"><span>What a location!
