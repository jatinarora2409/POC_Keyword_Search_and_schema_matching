This unique and open city loft-style space with high pitched beamed ceilings is in a convenient and coveted location with pool views from the front and some city and hill views from the back. This unit was altered to function as a studio which could easily be converted back to a one-bedroom with updated bathroom, massive walk-in closet and separate kitchen with window overlooking pool.

And then all the private kids leave and you have the leftovers for 7th. Very high rate of disabilities, way more boys (2\u002F3) than girls (1\u002F3), everybody is bouncy and hard to control.

We have now been out of Larchmont Charter [\\\"LCS\\\"] for 2 years \\u0026 what a great 2 years it has been. So happy we left \\u0026 actually found a well-run school to attend [we are in the arts\u002Ftech academy at Thomas starr king \\\"TSK\\\"]. The additional info that I can provide now, beyond my initial review below, which was made upon first leaving, is that LCS did not teach my son, identified as highly gifted, to the grade standards that LCS said it was teaching. In other words, my son was supposedly being taught at LCS above grade level but when he transferred to TSK middle school --lausd school--, he was significantly BEHIND his grade level--NOT above it. I heard this exact same story from other parents that left LCS \\u0026 went to another school--their child also significantly behind \\u0026 struggling. I attribute that in part or in whole to the poor teachers we experienced for our entire time at LCS [with exception of a couple teachers] \\u0026 the extremely poor administration. Original parents at LCS leaving in droves. Beware to people looking at this school--they talk a good game but are basically awful. Here\\u0027s my old review for why we left: Just left Larchmont this past yr, a tough decision b\u002Fc our child attended LCS k-5 \\u0026 we miss the kids\\u0026parents.There\\u0027re some great aspects of LCS, most important being it\\u0027s 12 grades,but the problems we saw at the start, including poorly trained teachers, cramped inadequate facilities [no lib, gym, computer lab], and a \\\"teach to the middle level of academics continued \\u0026 in fact worsened by the time we went to Selma Campus for 4th \\u0026 5th.Other concerns included erratic\u002Fshaming discipline, inappropriate use of parents in some teaching spots\\u0026 a top down leadership fail so our\\u0026other parents requests for change were resented\u002Fignored.We switched at 6th b\u002Fc it is the most typical time to matriculate for middle school otherwise we would have left MUCH sooner so bad was our experience..Our concerns with LCS were also informed by having an older child who did k-12 in LAUSD \\u0026 not seeing \\\"LCS-type issues\\\" during that time.So, we\\u0027re more savvy consumers, if you will, which I don\\u0027t think is true of many of the gushing reviewers here.I guess my best observation is that the earlier grades were fine, but if you want your child to have an excellent educ, LCS is not your best option for later grades.This is born out by the many spots now available at LCS for 6-11\",\"reviewerRating\":1,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":614718,\"maponicsId\":2341829,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fwest-hollywood\u002F14718-Larchmont-Charter-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16687474,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 31, 2016\",\"review\":\"Larchmont school system has excellent academics, but Fairfax campus has serious social problems. There\\u0027s a bullying problem and ineffectual leadership around solving it. The children of families that donate a lot of money get away with some very bad behavior.The physical bullying improved by creating a supervision program on the playground. However, the school does not have a handle on of the psychological bullying that girls do.At the heart of the problem is the Fairfax administration wanting to insulate themselves from input by parents. This problem started with the former principal of the campus, who went on to be in charge of the whole system. When she left, she replaced herself with someone that would be her \\\"yes man.\\\" The replacement principal lets the teachers do whatever they want. She once was a teacher there and is still friends with the teachers so she can\\u0027t properly guide them. The culture of the Fairfax campus is to admit no wrong when there is a problem, and pat each other on the back in private.It was with great trepidation that we moved to the Selma campus, but it really seems different here. The vibe of the campus is way more open and welcoming. The administration is overworked, but extremely effective in creating a positive social atmosphere. They have multiple mechanisms in place to work out issues. Nothing wild or weird, just counselors and other people willing to talk out the problems that are inevitable for all young people trying to learn how to be good people. All the adults who work there seem to be on board. The teachers genuinely care about all their students, not just the ones who are funding the school. I\\u0027m really pleased that our family stuck it out.I\\u0027m an educator and I know the academics are cutting edge. It\\u0027s apparent in the test scores of the kids from the \\\"poor\\\" demographic who do much better here than they do at regular public schools. That means a lot to our family, having come up from poor to middle class. And so far at this campus, no one has called our child \\\"poor\\\" like they did at Fairfax. The school culture makes it clear that it\\u0027s the wrong thing to do and the adults enforce that.We have friends who go to the Holly Grove campus, and apparently things are good there, too.

We have now been out of Larchmont Charter [\\\"LCS\\\"] for 2 years \\u0026 what a great 2 years it has been. So happy we left \\u0026 actually found a well-run school to attend [we are in the arts\u002Ftech academy at Thomas starr king \\\"TSK\\\"]. The additional info that I can provide now, beyond my initial review below, which was made upon first leaving, is that LCS did not teach my son, identified as highly gifted, to the grade standards that LCS said it was teaching. In other words, my son was supposedly being taught at LCS above grade level but when he transferred to TSK middle school --lausd school--, he was significantly BEHIND his grade level--NOT above it. I heard this exact same story from other parents that left LCS \\u0026 went to another school--their child also significantly behind \\u0026 struggling. I attribute that in part or in whole to the poor teachers we experienced for our entire time at LCS [with exception of a couple teachers] \\u0026 the extremely poor administration. Original parents at LCS leaving in droves. Beware to people looking at this school--they talk a good game but are basically awful. Here\\u0027s my old review for why we left: Just left Larchmont this past yr, a tough decision b\u002Fc our child attended LCS k-5 \\u0026 we miss the kids\\u0026parents.There\\u0027re some great aspects of LCS, most important being it\\u0027s 12 grades,but the problems we saw at the start, including poorly trained teachers, cramped inadequate facilities [no lib, gym, computer lab], and a \\\"teach to the middle level of academics continued \\u0026 in fact worsened by the time we went to Selma Campus for 4th \\u0026 5th.Other concerns included erratic\u002Fshaming discipline, inappropriate use of parents in some teaching spots\\u0026 a top down leadership fail so our\\u0026other parents requests for change were resented\u002Fignored.We switched at 6th b\u002Fc it is the most typical time to matriculate for middle school otherwise we would have left MUCH sooner so bad was our experience..Our concerns with LCS were also informed by having an older child who did k-12 in LAUSD \\u0026 not seeing \\\"LCS-type issues\\\" during that time.So, we\\u0027re more savvy consumers, if you will, which I don\\u0027t think is true of many of the gushing reviewers here.I guess my best observation is that the earlier grades were fine, but if you want your child to have an excellent educ, LCS is not your best option for later grades.This is born out by the many spots now available at LCS for 6-11\",\"reviewerRating\":1,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":614718,\"maponicsId\":2341829,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fwest-hollywood\u002F14718-Larchmont-Charter-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16687474,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 31, 2016\",\"review\":\"Larchmont school system has excellent academics, but Fairfax campus has serious social problems. There\\u0027s a bullying problem and ineffectual leadership around solving it. The children of families that donate a lot of money get away with some very bad behavior.The physical bullying improved by creating a supervision program on the playground. However, the school does not have a handle on of the psychological bullying that girls do.At the heart of the problem is the Fairfax administration wanting to insulate themselves from input by parents. This problem started with the former principal of the campus, who went on to be in charge of the whole system. When she left, she replaced herself with someone that would be her \\\"yes man.\\\" The replacement principal lets the teachers do whatever they want. She once was a teacher there and is still friends with the teachers so she can\\u0027t properly guide them. The culture of the Fairfax campus is to admit no wrong when there is a problem, and pat each other on the back in private.It was with great trepidation that we moved to the Selma campus, but it really seems different here. The vibe of the campus is way more open and welcoming. The administration is overworked, but extremely effective in creating a positive social atmosphere. They have multiple mechanisms in place to work out issues. Nothing wild or weird, just counselors and other people willing to talk out the problems that are inevitable for all young people trying to learn how to be good people. All the adults who work there seem to be on board. The teachers genuinely care about all their students, not just the ones who are funding the school. I\\u0027m really pleased that our family stuck it out.I\\u0027m an educator and I know the academics are cutting edge. It\\u0027s apparent in the test scores of the kids from the \\\"poor\\\" demographic who do much better here than they do at regular public schools.

We have now been out of Larchmont Charter [\\\"LCS\\\"] for 2 years \\u0026 what a great 2 years it has been. So happy we left \\u0026 actually found a well-run school to attend [we are in the arts\u002Ftech academy at Thomas starr king \\\"TSK\\\"]. The additional info that I can provide now, beyond my initial review below, which was made upon first leaving, is that LCS did not teach my son, identified as highly gifted, to the grade standards that LCS said it was teaching. In other words, my son was supposedly being taught at LCS above grade level but when he transferred to TSK middle school --lausd school--, he was significantly BEHIND his grade level--NOT above it. I heard this exact same story from other parents that left LCS \\u0026 went to another school--their child also significantly behind \\u0026 struggling. I attribute that in part or in whole to the poor teachers we experienced for our entire time at LCS [with exception of a couple teachers] \\u0026 the extremely poor administration. Original parents at LCS leaving in droves. Beware to people looking at this school--they talk a good game but are basically awful. Here\\u0027s my old review for why we left: Just left Larchmont this past yr, a tough decision b\u002Fc our child attended LCS k-5 \\u0026 we miss the kids\\u0026parents.There\\u0027re some great aspects of LCS, most important being it\\u0027s 12 grades,but the problems we saw at the start, including poorly trained teachers, cramped inadequate facilities [no lib, gym, computer lab], and a \\\"teach to the middle level of academics continued \\u0026 in fact worsened by the time we went to Selma Campus for 4th \\u0026 5th.Other concerns included erratic\u002Fshaming discipline, inappropriate use of parents in some teaching spots\\u0026 a top down leadership fail so our\\u0026other parents requests for change were resented\u002Fignored.We switched at 6th b\u002Fc it is the most typical time to matriculate for middle school otherwise we would have left MUCH sooner so bad was our experience..Our concerns with LCS were also informed by having an older child who did k-12 in LAUSD \\u0026 not seeing \\\"LCS-type issues\\\" during that time.So, we\\u0027re more savvy consumers, if you will, which I don\\u0027t think is true of many of the gushing reviewers here.I guess my best observation is that the earlier grades were fine, but if you want your child to have an excellent educ, LCS is not your best option for later grades.This is born out by the many spots now available at LCS for 6-11\",\"reviewerRating\":1,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":614718,\"maponicsId\":2341829,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fwest-hollywood\u002F14718-Larchmont-Charter-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16687474,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 31, 2016\",\"review\":\"Larchmont school system has excellent academics, but Fairfax campus has serious social problems. There\\u0027s a bullying problem and ineffectual leadership around solving it. The children of families that donate a lot of money get away with some very bad behavior.The physical bullying improved by creating a supervision program on the playground. However, the school does not have a handle on of the psychological bullying that girls do.At the heart of the problem is the Fairfax administration wanting to insulate themselves from input by parents. This problem started with the former principal of the campus, who went on to be in charge of the whole system. When she left, she replaced herself with someone that would be her \\\"yes man.\\\" The replacement principal lets the teachers do whatever they want. She once was a teacher there and is still friends with the teachers so she can\\u0027t properly guide them. The culture of the Fairfax campus is to admit no wrong when there is a problem, and pat each other on the back in private.It was with great trepidation that we moved to the Selma campus, but it really seems different here. The vibe of the campus is way more open and welcoming. The administration is overworked, but extremely effective in creating a positive social atmosphere. They have multiple mechanisms in place to work out issues. Nothing wild or weird, just counselors and other people willing to talk out the problems that are inevitable for all young people trying to learn how to be good people. All the adults who work there seem to be on board. The teachers genuinely care about all their students, not just the ones who are funding the school. I\\u0027m really pleased that our family stuck it out.I\\u0027m an educator and I know the academics are cutting edge. It\\u0027s apparent in the test scores of the kids from the \\\"poor\\\" demographic who do much better here than they do at regular public schools. That means a lot to our family, having come up from poor to middle class. And so far at this campus, no one has called our child \\\"poor\\\" like they did at Fairfax. The school culture makes it clear that it\\u0027s the wrong thing to do and the adults enforce that.We have friends who go to the Holly Grove campus, and apparently things are good there, too.

As we were touring all the private schools in the area, we decided to stop by the Open House at our zoned public school, Gardner - just to see for ourselves how much worse it would be. We were shocked to find that we loved everything about Gardner! The way it looks and feels (happy! Filled with art, music and laughter), and mostly its progressive mindset. We were so shaken up that we went back two more times to confirm that our initial impression was not skewed in some way... Our son is now a thriving 2nd grader at Gardner, and we truly do love this school.Gardner Street Elementary is a neighborhood gem with an engaged principal, excellent teachers and helpful staff, and a small but very active parent body that makes things happen. Many students live outside the school zone but they and their parents like Gardner so much that they\\u0027ve chosen to permit in.What makes Gardner so special are its diverse staff and students, family-like atmosphere, and the many \\\"extras\\\". Thanks to annual fundraisers coupled with lots of fun events for kids and families throughout the school year, \\\"non-essential\\\" classes that are not paid for by LAUSD and not offered in many public schools - such as Visual Art, Music, PE, Yoga, Organic Edible Garden, and (new!) Science Lab - are part of the everyday curriculum and available to every child at Gardner. There are many really great afterschool programs to choose from, and occasional workshops for parents\u002Fcaregivers. Campus beautification is ongoing.Besides all the fun, there is serious learning going on as well. Learning to truly *understand* and not just memorize to ace tests. So much learning goes on at school that - as supported by countless studies and best-performing schools in Finland - there are no homework requirements for the younger kids.Most importantly, my child has developed love for reading and learning, he is excited about going to school every day, and he feels safe there.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":4418512,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651566,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 27, 2019\",\"review\":\"We just love Gardner and couldn\\u0027t have had a better experience.

The school has a great group of parents running the parent group that raises money all year for the programs that LAUSD doesn\\u0027t provide.

My child started off the year almost reading, and now she is on level E (at grade level) and we still have two months left of school. She is also writing on her own. Due to Principal Rosner\\u0027s openness and willingness to collaborate, many parents have been able to be involved in our school. Specifically in our class, parents have been able to volunteer in weekly art classes, lead nutrition lessons (a parent is a nutritionist and designed a workshop with fresh, healthy foods for kids that coincided with the letters of the alphabet they were learning), reading groups in class, chaperoning field trips etc. The high level of parent engagement makes this school very special. The art studio, physical education, and gardening programs are funded entirely by the parent group, Friends of Gardner. These programs enrich the curriculum, and are so beloved by the students. The open house and art show last week was a clear example of the success of the school. As a parent volunteer, I was able to witness the behind the scenes action of the flurry of art teachers and other volunteer parents working hard to display the well designed art installations before the bell hit 3:00. The principal worked alongside the parents, hanging art and maintaining his calm and upbeat demeanor even under the pressure of the clock. The event came together beautifully and I was so proud to be a member of the Gardner community. Students were so happy to have their families at school; the afternoon of student musicians, vibrant artwork, yummy fresh fruits from the garden, and an impressive classroom where student work was proudly displayed was a highlight of the year.

We chose our home elementary school over local charters\u002Fmagnets.The reason the school\\u0027s score dropped from an 8 to a 6 is based on last year\\u0027s Common Core tests even though the California Board of Education suspended the state’s school accountability system. Moreover, the Board of Education voted not to produce an Academic Performance Index (API) for the 2014-15 SY (the index uses student results to rank schools and to identify those that need improvement). Many educational professionals strongly believe current testing measures affluence rather than learning. Gardner is a Title 1 school with 50% of its children receiving free\u002Freduced lunch. This creates a socioeconomic and racially diverse school. However, this also means 30% of the students are learning English as a 2nd language and many students have limited access to computers\u002FI-pads compared to counterparts at surrounding schools. This is an important fact as last year\\u0027s test were electronic instead of the paper and pencil method used previously. Unfortunately, in light of these facts, Great Schools chose to adjust Gardner\\u0027s ranking based on last year\\u0027s test scores.Our principal (former vice principal at Wonderland rated a 10) has made positive changes to ensure each teacher at every grade level is exceptional. Teachers are well versed in traditional \\u0026 modern teaching methods. Ample training is provided to teachers to ensure they create a healthy learning environment and one that supports each child to grow emotionally. The children receive P.E. twice a week, music once a week, art once a week and enrichment courses that are provided on a rotational basis such as drama and garden. Additionally, enrichment classes are offered after school such as engineering and robotics. The children at Gardner are wonderful and kind. The landscaping\u002Fbuilding structure provides a beautiful background for learning. The teachers are a perfect blend of loving and strict. Both children and teachers are taught principles of talking circles or peacemaking circles. These circles use a structural framework to build relationships and to address conflict within a community. This in turn creates an environment where children play well together. Lastly, the parents are lovely! They are friendly and involved in making our school wonderful.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":1805342,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651535,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Oct 13, 2015\",\"review\":\"The grade dropped from 8 to 6 for this school.

From clubs, to leadership class, to dance and theatre shows, to great master classes and field trips- she got to do more in Middle school than one might expect in a public school setting. She also took foreign language and visual arts as well as her performing arts classes (dance, music and theatre.). The majority of teachers and staff are at the top of their game and truly care about the student experience at the school. The majority of classes she had showed good academic rigor and expectations for students. The complaints she expressed more than a few times included frustration about the work ethic of the students (not teachers) in some of her classes and the fact that the school could do more to reward all the students that do all the right things instead of pointing focus on poor choices made by some.

The school is extremely diverse and offers a pretty good quantity of extra curriculars. The students at Fairfax are generally open minded. The budget cuts the school has suffered haven\\u0027t allowed it to improve a whole lot, but the campus has become significantly nicer. The school allows for educational and social expansion.\",\"reviewerRating\":3,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602068,\"maponicsId\":1263465,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2068-Fairfax-Senior-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":14510078,\"reviewedBy\":\"student\",\"datePosted\":\"Apr 25, 2011\",\"review\":\"I have been going to Fairfax for only 8 months and I\\u0027m in love with it.... the students are super friendly and teachers are committed to their jobs... they teach us a looott more than what the textbook says.... and AP teachers are the best there could be....

There are very few teachers that do invest on the students education. As well, teachers who don\\u0027t care enough to teach students that all they have students do is read from textbooks and answer a few questions and your done for the day. But, it is not just teachers, its the counselors, administration, and the district who need to invest on giving students the right tools. Students are not left behind, the majority don\\u0027t care about continuing or pursuing higher education. Only a few of the students care and those students are deprived and striped out of having a the right level of education.

As we were touring all the private schools in the area, we decided to stop by the Open House at our zoned public school, Gardner - just to see for ourselves how much worse it would be. We were shocked to find that we loved everything about Gardner! The way it looks and feels (happy! Filled with art, music and laughter), and mostly its progressive mindset. We were so shaken up that we went back two more times to confirm that our initial impression was not skewed in some way... Our son is now a thriving 2nd grader at Gardner, and we truly do love this school.Gardner Street Elementary is a neighborhood gem with an engaged principal, excellent teachers and helpful staff, and a small but very active parent body that makes things happen. Many students live outside the school zone but they and their parents like Gardner so much that they\\u0027ve chosen to permit in.What makes Gardner so special are its diverse staff and students, family-like atmosphere, and the many \\\"extras\\\". Thanks to annual fundraisers coupled with lots of fun events for kids and families throughout the school year, \\\"non-essential\\\" classes that are not paid for by LAUSD and not offered in many public schools - such as Visual Art, Music, PE, Yoga, Organic Edible Garden, and (new!) Science Lab - are part of the everyday curriculum and available to every child at Gardner. There are many really great afterschool programs to choose from, and occasional workshops for parents\u002Fcaregivers. Campus beautification is ongoing.Besides all the fun, there is serious learning going on as well. Learning to truly *understand* and not just memorize to ace tests. So much learning goes on at school that - as supported by countless studies and best-performing schools in Finland - there are no homework requirements for the younger kids.Most importantly, my child has developed love for reading and learning, he is excited about going to school every day, and he feels safe there.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":4418512,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651566,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 27, 2019\",\"review\":\"We just love Gardner and couldn\\u0027t have had a better experience.

My child started off the year almost reading, and now she is on level E (at grade level) and we still have two months left of school. She is also writing on her own. Due to Principal Rosner\\u0027s openness and willingness to collaborate, many parents have been able to be involved in our school. Specifically in our class, parents have been able to volunteer in weekly art classes, lead nutrition lessons (a parent is a nutritionist and designed a workshop with fresh, healthy foods for kids that coincided with the letters of the alphabet they were learning), reading groups in class, chaperoning field trips etc. The high level of parent engagement makes this school very special. The art studio, physical education, and gardening programs are funded entirely by the parent group, Friends of Gardner. These programs enrich the curriculum, and are so beloved by the students. The open house and art show last week was a clear example of the success of the school. As a parent volunteer, I was able to witness the behind the scenes action of the flurry of art teachers and other volunteer parents working hard to display the well designed art installations before the bell hit 3:00. The principal worked alongside the parents, hanging art and maintaining his calm and upbeat demeanor even under the pressure of the clock. The event came together beautifully and I was so proud to be a member of the Gardner community. Students were so happy to have their families at school; the afternoon of student musicians, vibrant artwork, yummy fresh fruits from the garden, and an impressive classroom where student work was proudly displayed was a highlight of the year.

We chose our home elementary school over local charters\u002Fmagnets.The reason the school\\u0027s score dropped from an 8 to a 6 is based on last year\\u0027s Common Core tests even though the California Board of Education suspended the state’s school accountability system. Moreover, the Board of Education voted not to produce an Academic Performance Index (API) for the 2014-15 SY (the index uses student results to rank schools and to identify those that need improvement). Many educational professionals strongly believe current testing measures affluence rather than learning. Gardner is a Title 1 school with 50% of its children receiving free\u002Freduced lunch. This creates a socioeconomic and racially diverse school. However, this also means 30% of the students are learning English as a 2nd language and many students have limited access to computers\u002FI-pads compared to counterparts at surrounding schools. This is an important fact as last year\\u0027s test were electronic instead of the paper and pencil method used previously. Unfortunately, in light of these facts, Great Schools chose to adjust Gardner\\u0027s ranking based on last year\\u0027s test scores.Our principal (former vice principal at Wonderland rated a 10) has made positive changes to ensure each teacher at every grade level is exceptional. Teachers are well versed in traditional \\u0026 modern teaching methods. Ample training is provided to teachers to ensure they create a healthy learning environment and one that supports each child to grow emotionally. The children receive P.E. twice a week, music once a week, art once a week and enrichment courses that are provided on a rotational basis such as drama and garden. Additionally, enrichment classes are offered after school such as engineering and robotics. The children at Gardner are wonderful and kind. The landscaping\u002Fbuilding structure provides a beautiful background for learning. The teachers are a perfect blend of loving and strict. Both children and teachers are taught principles of talking circles or peacemaking circles. These circles use a structural framework to build relationships and to address conflict within a community. This in turn creates an environment where children play well together. Lastly, the parents are lovely! They are friendly and involved in making our school wonderful.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":1805342,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651535,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Oct 13, 2015\",\"review\":\"The grade dropped from 8 to 6 for this school.

From clubs, to leadership class, to dance and theatre shows, to great master classes and field trips- she got to do more in Middle school than one might expect in a public school setting. She also took foreign language and visual arts as well as her performing arts classes (dance, music and theatre.). The majority of teachers and staff are at the top of their game and truly care about the student experience at the school. The majority of classes she had showed good academic rigor and expectations for students. The complaints she expressed more than a few times included frustration about the work ethic of the students (not teachers) in some of her classes and the fact that the school could do more to reward all the students that do all the right things instead of pointing focus on poor choices made by some.

As adults, we must know how to resolve conflicts and set good examples for our children and I can imagine that teachers do the same. If you speak in a demeaning way and out of rage about the place where you work and your boss, you always have choices. Go work somewhere else!! Your students do not deserve such bitterness.
