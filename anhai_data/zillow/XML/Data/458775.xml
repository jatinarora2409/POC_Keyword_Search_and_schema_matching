	<overview>Substantial price reduction of $200K!  Unbelievable value at under $350 per square foot.   The expansive, new, upscale home is located on a quiet cul-de-sac in Chevy Chase, DC. Contemporary design and meticulous construction create the perfect harmony between luxury and comfort for superior livability. Versatile spaces, including six bedrooms and five and a half baths across three above-grade levels, with 10-foot ceilings throughout, offer room to congregate and to separate, providing areas to work and to play for every generation.    On the main level, a grand two-story entry foyer sets the home's tailored modern aesthetic tone. A gourmet kitchen with a large island flows to an open dining area and family room, a private office, a temperature-controlled wine room, a mudroom adjacent to an ample two-car garage, and a bedroom suite with a full bath. The main level (itself a total of 2,630 square feet) has no steps,  ramp entry from the garage, a curb-less shower, and a large bedroom suite, make it perfect for multi-generational living or aging in place.  On the second level, a spacious sitting area overlooks the entry foyer and offers abundant light. Also on this level are a generous owner suite with dual walk-in closets and a spa-like bath, a laundry room, two additional bedrooms sharing a Jack and Jill bath, a fifth bedroom with a walk-in closet, and attached bath; and a large storage closet.  The third level provides an enormous open play space with treetop views, a media room, bedroom six, plus a full bath.   The exterior has a grilling patio with a built-in natural gas grill and stainless steel cabinetry, perfect for entertaining and enjoying dinners al fresco.    With over 8,000 square feet of finished living space (over 8,500 square feet total), set on an 11,823 square foot lot, this majestic home provides suburban-scale living in a peaceful setting without sacrificing the conveniences of city living.    ** Be sure to View Video Tour**Read more</overview>
