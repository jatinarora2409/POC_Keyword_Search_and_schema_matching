If parents object to their (non-rich) child being bullied by a rich child, the administration will: 1. scold the parent for not having empathy for the bully; 2. tell the parent that they are hurt and disgusted by the use of the word bully (\\\"this is a CHILD, how dare you call him names?\\\"), 3. rescind the offer of re-enrollment for the following school year if the parents of the bullied child won\\u0027t stop complaining.

He was accepted at a selective liberal arts college and used Waldorf school projects to easily put together a fabulous portfolio. Certain students may not do so well at Waldorf: kids with drug problems, mean girls, or those less creative who can only thrive in the robotic pedagogy of your average public high school. Gifted students, nice kids, artists, musicians, super smart young people -- they are more likely to thrive in a less structured teaching environment. My son found all his Waldorf classes interesting and engaging and the teachers all had advanced degrees. Waldorf is about educating the whole child -- encouraging academic excellence but also requiring creativity and good character. When it comes to the teen years, peer influence is all important.

Ms. Scott, the new principal is firm yet loving - and has strong values of respect and care and she walks the talk. The campus is totally remodeled. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. Dr. Fagan (4th\u002F5th grade teacher) gave up university teaching opportunities to teach at DWLC. She is just one example of the treasures we have at DWLC. After attending DWLC\\u0027s annual African Am. History celeb., we were deeply impressed with the depth and soul of the presentations and felt proud that our child was learning such important historical and cultural lessons about our country. We are not African American ourselves - the school is in fact quite diverse ethnically. Don\\u0027t just look at scores! I believe my child will be a more compassionate citizen because of his unique learning environment at Dr. William Cobb Elementary.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606353,\"maponicsId\":1407908,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6353-Cobb-William-L.-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":14534630,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Oct 4, 2013\",\"review\":\"Wow Cobb GREAT GREAT GREAT.

Gifted students, nice kids, artists, musicians, super smart young people -- they are more likely to thrive in a less structured teaching environment. My son found all his Waldorf classes interesting and engaging and the teachers all had advanced degrees. Waldorf is about educating the whole child -- encouraging academic excellence but also requiring creativity and good character. When it comes to the teen years, peer influence is all important.

Coming from a student that has always worked hard to achieve good grades this was a concern. Luckily we moved to Marin and enrolled our children in a public school . Having always felt private school was important to get the best education possible, it was quite eye opening to hear from most of her new teachers that our daughter was way behind in the basic s required for college.

How is this diverse??? Oh well. I am going into my senior year and I hope that this school changes in a positive way because I want my last year to be the best.

My son is African American. 99%-100% of the teachers are white and the Principal and Executive Director are white. That shouldn t matter, but it does. The teachers haven t the skills to address the cultural diversity of their students appropriately; therefore, students are negatively misjudged. The teaching is inconsistent; depending on how many students are allowed to disrupt the class and how well the teacher is able to connect and engage them. Over these three years, students have been asked to leave if they re failing, expelled or dropped out.

I was reticent about Cobb (largely due to the attendance numbers), but fell in love with the school. Principal Slife is in his 2nd year and is incredibly energetic and enthusiastic. The kids and parents love him. The Family Liaison, Ms. Collier, is also fantastic. They started an attendance program this year (I saw the first award ceremony this morning and it was great -- a lot of parent participation). We switched because our wait pool school is SO much closer, but that is the ONLY reason we moved. In 3 weeks, we already felt like such a part of the Cobb community. As to the posting by \\\"a Community Member\\\" on March 16, your comment is incredibly misguided and ignorant. The school is small, so under the statistics principle \\\"law of small numbers\\\", the test scores have little statistical significance.

The diversity is amazing - finally a school with a good racial mix, something that is difficult to find at other schools. There is a good anti-bullying campaign.

My son has been at Rosa Parks for three years now, and I am getting ready to to send my daughter to kindergarten there. We\\u0027ve tried both the Gen Ed (now with a science\u002Ftechnology focus!) and Japanese programs and are very happy with teachers and school culture in both. The ongoing struggle, as seen in the numbers above, is closing the gap in outcomes between kids from high-income and low-income families. My 2¢ as a parent who has watched two principals and teachers in two programs across three grades, is that the school community as a whole is committed to helping not just kids but families through the big changes shaking up neighborhoods: rising rents, evictions, and the departure of many middle-class families who just can\\u0027t afford the city anymore. The good news is that Rosa Parks has a lot of energetic and engaged parents from all walks of life, and remains deeply connected to both Japanese-American and African-American civil rights movements. Yes, there are two programs, but the school feels unified. The entire school starts the day together in physical activity (alternating Japanese calisthetics and the Cha-Cha Slide), then kids get mixed into combined small groups for reading practice. All the kids spend lots of time with a garden teacher, with the plants and chickens as the basis for science lessons and weekly salad lunches. All the kids see performances at nearby Civic Center arts organizations. All the kids do engineering and science projects in the new hands-on learning studio. (As an aside, the school has a partnership with Boys and Girls Club, which means that my son spends his afternoons getting music lessons and homework help at the clubhouse on Fulton and Gough -- it\\u0027s the best deal in SF.) Rosa Parks is, as other parents have said, a hidden gem in the heart of San Francisco.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606420,\"maponicsId\":3827582,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6420-Parks-Rosa-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665238,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Nov 18, 2015\",\"review\":\"Rosa Parks is a hidden gem!

In my opinion, Redding has many different communities rather than one tight-knit one which is such a pity as, in appearance, it\\u0027s clearly very diverse but, like the colors of the rainbow, they remain separate from one another. Much needs to be done to bring the many groups together in the hope that there can be more understanding, acceptance, tolerance, inclusiveness and to inevitably create a more harmonious environment for all.Yes, bullying does occur as with every school but instances do seem to be increasing mainly due to the fact that not much, if anything at all, is done to tackle it. The children are called into to the office for a little chat and swiftly sent back to class... Next!The principal is extremely dedicated and she and her team work incredibly hard to run the school as smoothly as possible, however, she is at times struggling to interact with the many different groups that make up the Redding community in a more impactful and relatable level.All that said, the teachers from TK all the way through to 5th Grade are just pure class and the saving grace.

My special thanks to Ms. Gross and Mrs. Sheredy. My children who did not speak any English became fluent in no time! They could independently do their homework just a couple of months later. The level of academics is what any parent could wish for! 2) Discipline. Your children will definitely will be taught how to behave. I love how each and every teacher in Spring Valley guide and educate their crazy young crowd! 3) The best Principal! Mrs. Kwong knows her students by their names, knows the parents and is always present at school with her incredibly gentle and unique way of managing the school. 4) Amazing field trips.

I\\u0027ve tried everything to get her math score up and asked them what they can do and no real good help besides online things for my daughter to do. What happened to one on one help? The Kuna school I\\u0027m considering offers just that. It\\u0027s called title one program. Wish thethey had it at Monroe. Love the school hate the Math program and that God awful unessary CHAIN LADY (as my daughter calls her) get read of her please....\",\"reviewerRating\":4,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606412,\"maponicsId\":1781676,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6412-Monroe-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":14535100,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 4, 2013\",\"review\":\"Monroe School is a great school because the Principal is very involved with the parents needs and students.

Also, there is no more GATE Program for more advanced students, OR Extra Credit! WTH??Homework - My son has never had a problem, but some of his friends have 2 hours a night.School Facility - Total redo of the interior made his first entire year a mess. 2018-19 they are supposed to redo the entire schoolyard.

They did away with GATE, which I don\\u0027t necessarily mind even though my kid qualified for it. However, for \\\"differentiation\\\" they have a two teacher system for each classroom. So, two teachers in the same class for LangArts\u002FSocSciences and for Math\u002FScience. In some classes, it works well. Both teachers teach, communicate with students and parents, etc. In others, it\\u0027s horrible. One teacher does all the work. The other hardly ever speaks to the class, never communicates, certainly doesn\\u0027t help with any so called differentiation methods. School Loop is what they use to track homework and grades and to communicate with the parents. Unfortunately, only some of the teachers bother keeping up with this. You can also forget about getting a timely response to an email (if you have it answered at all). Even though there is a scheduled hour for science, my kid\\u0027s class ends up doing double math the majority of the time. This means their science grades are based on very few assignments in addition to the rather horrible fact that they are not learning much science!It\\u0027s very easy to get lost in the shuffle here.

On the positive side, most teachers were deeply committed to the kids and were extremely skilled, almost heroic, instructors. Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t. Mission wins on architecture, weather, transportation, location and student to faculty ratio. Lowell wins on academic reputation and performance.

Also, they will not tolerate bullying, they are very strict. I highly recommend this high school.

The program staff will help you if your child wants to get into the military as well !!!This is the only high school that has a JROTC that is for the “Navy” ( other SF High Sch. are army\u002Fmarines)There is so much to say about this program but not enough time.

My son has been at Rosa Parks for three years now, and I am getting ready to to send my daughter to kindergarten there. We\\u0027ve tried both the Gen Ed (now with a science\u002Ftechnology focus!) and Japanese programs and are very happy with teachers and school culture in both. The ongoing struggle, as seen in the numbers above, is closing the gap in outcomes between kids from high-income and low-income families. My 2¢ as a parent who has watched two principals and teachers in two programs across three grades, is that the school community as a whole is committed to helping not just kids but families through the big changes shaking up neighborhoods: rising rents, evictions, and the departure of many middle-class families who just can\\u0027t afford the city anymore. The good news is that Rosa Parks has a lot of energetic and engaged parents from all walks of life, and remains deeply connected to both Japanese-American and African-American civil rights movements. Yes, there are two programs, but the school feels unified. The entire school starts the day together in physical activity (alternating Japanese calisthetics and the Cha-Cha Slide), then kids get mixed into combined small groups for reading practice. All the kids spend lots of time with a garden teacher, with the plants and chickens as the basis for science lessons and weekly salad lunches. All the kids see performances at nearby Civic Center arts organizations. All the kids do engineering and science projects in the new hands-on learning studio. (As an aside, the school has a partnership with Boys and Girls Club, which means that my son spends his afternoons getting music lessons and homework help at the clubhouse on Fulton and Gough -- it\\u0027s the best deal in SF.)

Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds.

Here are my impression FWIW. Mission class sizes are as low as 18 students, Lowell as high as 40+. Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t. Mission wins on architecture, weather, transportation, location and student to faculty ratio. Lowell wins on academic reputation and performance. Both campuses are equally safe with dedicated staff, though Mission\\u0027s makes more of an effort with more to prove.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23,
