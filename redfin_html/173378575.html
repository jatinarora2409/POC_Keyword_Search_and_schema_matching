In my opinion, Redding has many different communities rather than one tight-knit one which is such a pity as, in appearance, it\\u0027s clearly very diverse but, like the colors of the rainbow, they remain separate from one another. Much needs to be done to bring the many groups together in the hope that there can be more understanding, acceptance, tolerance, inclusiveness and to inevitably create a more harmonious environment for all.Yes, bullying does occur as with every school but instances do seem to be increasing mainly due to the fact that not much, if anything at all, is done to tackle it. The children are called into to the office for a little chat and swiftly sent back to class... Next!The principal is extremely dedicated and she and her team work incredibly hard to run the school as smoothly as possible, however, she is at times struggling to interact with the many different groups that make up the Redding community in a more impactful and relatable level.All that said, the teachers from TK all the way through to 5th Grade are just pure class and the saving grace.

My son has been at Rosa Parks for three years now, and I am getting ready to to send my daughter to kindergarten there. We\\u0027ve tried both the Gen Ed (now with a science\u002Ftechnology focus!) and Japanese programs and are very happy with teachers and school culture in both. The ongoing struggle, as seen in the numbers above, is closing the gap in outcomes between kids from high-income and low-income families. My 2¢ as a parent who has watched two principals and teachers in two programs across three grades, is that the school community as a whole is committed to helping not just kids but families through the big changes shaking up neighborhoods: rising rents, evictions, and the departure of many middle-class families who just can\\u0027t afford the city anymore. The good news is that Rosa Parks has a lot of energetic and engaged parents from all walks of life, and remains deeply connected to both Japanese-American and African-American civil rights movements. Yes, there are two programs, but the school feels unified. The entire school starts the day together in physical activity (alternating Japanese calisthetics and the Cha-Cha Slide), then kids get mixed into combined small groups for reading practice. All the kids spend lots of time with a garden teacher, with the plants and chickens as the basis for science lessons and weekly salad lunches. All the kids see performances at nearby Civic Center arts organizations. All the kids do engineering and science projects in the new hands-on learning studio. (As an aside, the school has a partnership with Boys and Girls Club, which means that my son spends his afternoons getting music lessons and homework help at the clubhouse on Fulton and Gough -- it\\u0027s the best deal in SF.)

My special thanks to Ms. Gross and Mrs. Sheredy. My children who did not speak any English became fluent in no time! They could independently do their homework just a couple of months later. The level of academics is what any parent could wish for! 2) Discipline. Your children will definitely will be taught how to behave. I love how each and every teacher in Spring Valley guide and educate their crazy young crowd! 3) The best Principal! Mrs. Kwong knows her students by their names, knows the parents and is always present at school with her incredibly gentle and unique way of managing the school. 4) Amazing field trips.

I\\u0027m sure that was deliberate, but it speaks to the transparency of their communication with parents. They did away with GATE, which I don\\u0027t necessarily mind even though my kid qualified for it. However, for \\\"differentiation\\\" they have a two teacher system for each classroom. So, two teachers in the same class for LangArts\u002FSocSciences and for Math\u002FScience. In some classes, it works well. Both teachers teach, communicate with students and parents, etc. In others, it\\u0027s horrible. One teacher does all the work. The other hardly ever speaks to the class, never communicates, certainly doesn\\u0027t help with any so called differentiation methods. School Loop is what they use to track homework and grades and to communicate with the parents. Unfortunately, only some of the teachers bother keeping up with this. You can also forget about getting a timely response to an email (if you have it answered at all). Even though there is a scheduled hour for science, my kid\\u0027s class ends up doing double math the majority of the time.

On the positive side, most teachers were deeply committed to the kids and were extremely skilled, almost heroic, instructors. Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t.

My son has been at Rosa Parks for three years now, and I am getting ready to to send my daughter to kindergarten there. We\\u0027ve tried both the Gen Ed (now with a science\u002Ftechnology focus!) and Japanese programs and are very happy with teachers and school culture in both. The ongoing struggle, as seen in the numbers above, is closing the gap in outcomes between kids from high-income and low-income families. My 2¢ as a parent who has watched two principals and teachers in two programs across three grades, is that the school community as a whole is committed to helping not just kids but families through the big changes shaking up neighborhoods: rising rents, evictions, and the departure of many middle-class families who just can\\u0027t afford the city anymore. The good news is that Rosa Parks has a lot of energetic and engaged parents from all walks of life, and remains deeply connected to both Japanese-American and African-American civil rights movements. Yes, there are two programs, but the school feels unified. The entire school starts the day together in physical activity (alternating Japanese calisthetics and the Cha-Cha Slide), then kids get mixed into combined small groups for reading practice. All the kids spend lots of time with a garden teacher, with the plants and chickens as the basis for science lessons and weekly salad lunches. All the kids see performances at nearby Civic Center arts organizations. All the kids do engineering and science projects in the new hands-on learning studio. (As an aside, the school has a partnership with Boys and Girls Club, which means that my son spends his afternoons getting music lessons and homework help at the clubhouse on Fulton and Gough -- it\\u0027s the best deal in SF.) Rosa Parks is, as other parents have said, a hidden gem in the heart of San Francisco.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606420,\"maponicsId\":3827582,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6420-Parks-Rosa-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665238,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Nov 18, 2015\",\"review\":\"Rosa Parks is a hidden gem!

In my opinion, Redding has many different communities rather than one tight-knit one which is such a pity as, in appearance, it\\u0027s clearly very diverse but, like the colors of the rainbow, they remain separate from one another. Much needs to be done to bring the many groups together in the hope that there can be more understanding, acceptance, tolerance, inclusiveness and to inevitably create a more harmonious environment for all.Yes, bullying does occur as with every school but instances do seem to be increasing mainly due to the fact that not much, if anything at all, is done to tackle it. The children are called into to the office for a little chat and swiftly sent back to class... Next!The principal is extremely dedicated and she and her team work incredibly hard to run the school as smoothly as possible, however, she is at times struggling to interact with the many different groups that make up the Redding community in a more impactful and relatable level.All that said, the teachers from TK all the way through to 5th Grade are just pure class and the saving grace.

The arts are integrated into the school\\u0027s approach to education, and students spend 3 hours a week in specific arts classes. In elementary school, students have dance, music, and visual arts every week, and in middle school students select from electives that could include art, guitar, piano, creative writing, dance, video, and others. The school also places a strong emphasis on promoting the social and emotional development of its students and creating a strong community and safe learning environment. We came to CACS 3 years ago in part because of our frustration with the heavy emphasis on worksheet-based learning that dominated our older son\\u0027s experience in his SFUSD school. Our children are now in 3rd and 6th grades, and we couldn\\u0027t have made a better choice. They get a good mix of project-based learning and fundamentals, and a level of individual attention that is inspiring.

On the positive side, most teachers were deeply committed to the kids and were extremely skilled, almost heroic, instructors. Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t.
