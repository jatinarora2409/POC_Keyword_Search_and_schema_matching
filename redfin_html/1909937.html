The school also places a strong emphasis on promoting the social and emotional development of its students and creating a strong community and safe learning environment.

The arts are integrated into the school\\u0027s approach to education, and students spend 3 hours a week in specific arts classes. In elementary school, students have dance, music, and visual arts every week, and in middle school students select from electives that could include art, guitar, piano, creative writing, dance, video, and others. The school also places a strong emphasis on promoting the social and emotional development of its students and creating a strong community and safe learning environment. We came to CACS 3 years ago in part because of our frustration with the heavy emphasis on worksheet-based learning that dominated our older son\\u0027s experience in his SFUSD school. Our children are now in 3rd and 6th grades, and we couldn\\u0027t have made a better choice.

However she has blossomed and made new friends and tried different sports and clubs. So we\\u0027re huge fans, right? Not quite.....Our daughter WAS a huge advocate and fan -- however in the past two years the administration has turned over and the new APs are not at all liked. At the same time the principal (who was never popular) has become even more controlling and panders to families with special needs or IEP to try and curry favor. She is at times downright rude to some parents and I hear has teachers terrified for their jobs. This has impacted my daughter as she loves her teachers.All the administration cares about is their school rating and ensuring the achievement rate of african americans, english language learners and special education students improve (going so far as to give 50% even when there is no homework turned in and not suspending students as having a low suspension rate boosts ratings). That said the majority of the students are left to their own devices. Ask to see the AP exam pass rates or college readiness scores and compare that to the GPAs. They don\\u0027t align.Yes this is a public high school with a varied student body. The same social pressures, challenges and issues exist here as with all public schools in an urban setting. The difference I feel is that with the size, there is no hiding it. Hence discipline issues need to be addressed. Stop the teacher turnover (hence stop bullying the teachers and improve the climate). They are terrified of the principal. This school has the potential to be a true gem. However we need new blood at the administrative level. Assume ALL students can achieve instead of lowering standards just to graduate everyone. Make sure to nuture and invest in the new teachers and ensure the high turnover stops. Deal with the bad teachers but keep the good ones from turning over. So stay on top of your child and the school. Find the good teachers as there are many of them and avoid the bad ones. Befriend those wonderful parents who spend hours volunteering. Again, our daughter has had some wonderful teachers that she loves.

One cannot walk down the hallway to between classes without witnessing students pushing or punching each other. Often times the staff just stand there and watch the fight, or they just keep walking. When there are consequences for fighting, it is in the form of a \\\"restorative circle\\\" which does nothing to prevent future conflicts. Recently, a large group of students instigated a fight at a nearby store and the faculty had them discuss their differences over a pizza. One must then conclude that starting a fight is a good way to get a pizza party.Very few teachers show any competence in teaching their classes. The majority of the good teachers left and the only good teacher still here is the AP Statistics teacher. The majority of teachers are unable to control their students and have to take a significant amount of class time each day telling students to behave, which greatly detracts from instructional time. Additionally, many teachers use their position as a soapbox to endorse their own political views. Of particular note is the \\\"AP\\\" \\\"Literature\\\" class, which deserves no part of its official title. The \\\"teacher\\\" shows blatant favoritism towards the students who agree with her views. We have spent class time watching music videos and discussing whether or not they are sufficiently in accordance with the teacher\\u0027s political views. For the record, videos set in foreign countries starring white people are unacceptable, but Beyonce\\u0027s \\\"Formation\\\" is a powerful piece of literature. If you do anything to incur her displeasure, she will email all of your other teachers in an attempt to damage your reputation. As mentioned earlier, the school has an extremely high turnover rate and it is often the good teachers who leave. Both the students and the teachers are fearful of the administration, especially the principal, and this is likely the main reason for the high turnover rate.

My son has been at Rosa Parks for three years now, and I am getting ready to to send my daughter to kindergarten there. We\\u0027ve tried both the Gen Ed (now with a science\u002Ftechnology focus!) and Japanese programs and are very happy with teachers and school culture in both. The ongoing struggle, as seen in the numbers above, is closing the gap in outcomes between kids from high-income and low-income families. My 2¢ as a parent who has watched two principals and teachers in two programs across three grades, is that the school community as a whole is committed to helping not just kids but families through the big changes shaking up neighborhoods: rising rents, evictions, and the departure of many middle-class families who just can\\u0027t afford the city anymore. The good news is that Rosa Parks has a lot of energetic and engaged parents from all walks of life, and remains deeply connected to both Japanese-American and African-American civil rights movements. Yes, there are two programs, but the school feels unified. The entire school starts the day together in physical activity (alternating Japanese calisthetics and the Cha-Cha Slide), then kids get mixed into combined small groups for reading practice. All the kids spend lots of time with a garden teacher, with the plants and chickens as the basis for science lessons and weekly salad lunches. All the kids see performances at nearby Civic Center arts organizations. All the kids do engineering and science projects in the new hands-on learning studio. (As an aside, the school has a partnership with Boys and Girls Club, which means that my son spends his afternoons getting music lessons and homework help at the clubhouse on Fulton and Gough -- it\\u0027s the best deal in SF.) Rosa Parks is, as other parents have said, a hidden gem in the heart of San Francisco.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606420,\"maponicsId\":3827582,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6420-Parks-Rosa-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665238,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Nov 18, 2015\",\"review\":\"Rosa Parks is a hidden gem!

(science and nutrition) A grant was secured to bring Grammy nominated jazz musician Anthony Brown into the classrooms to help expose curious minds to a world of music they normally don\\u0027t have access to. The SF Symphony and the SF Ballet are heavily involved with special programming for the students. JBBP program has attracted students from all over the city and this diversity makes Rosa Parks Elem. a must see school for many incoming families. But above all else, the faculty, students and families that make up this community are committed to fostering a strong community school environment.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606420,\"maponicsId\":1071914,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6420-Parks-Rosa-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":14535293,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Nov 13, 2010\",\"review\":\"Improving through great strong leadership .

In my opinion, Redding has many different communities rather than one tight-knit one which is such a pity as, in appearance, it\\u0027s clearly very diverse but, like the colors of the rainbow, they remain separate from one another. Much needs to be done to bring the many groups together in the hope that there can be more understanding, acceptance, tolerance, inclusiveness and to inevitably create a more harmonious environment for all.Yes, bullying does occur as with every school but instances do seem to be increasing mainly due to the fact that not much, if anything at all, is done to tackle it. The children are called into to the office for a little chat and swiftly sent back to class... Next!The principal is extremely dedicated and she and her team work incredibly hard to run the school as smoothly as possible, however, she is at times struggling to interact with the many different groups that make up the Redding community in a more impactful and relatable level.All that said, the teachers from TK all the way through to 5th Grade are just pure class and the saving grace.

I\\u0027ve tried everything to get her math score up and asked them what they can do and no real good help besides online things for my daughter to do. What happened to one on one help? The Kuna school I\\u0027m considering offers just that. It\\u0027s called title one program. Wish thethey had it at Monroe. Love the school hate the Math program and that God awful unessary CHAIN LADY (as my daughter calls her) get read of her please....\",\"reviewerRating\":4,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606412,\"maponicsId\":1781676,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6412-Monroe-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":14535100,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 4, 2013\",\"review\":\"Monroe School is a great school because the Principal is very involved with the parents needs and students.

On the positive side, most teachers were deeply committed to the kids and were extremely skilled, almost heroic, instructors. Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t. Mission wins on architecture, weather, transportation, location and student to faculty ratio. Lowell wins on academic reputation and performance.

I always feel good about my kids being there, if something were to go wrong I know that the staff\u002Fsecurity will do everything in their power as a team to make sure the students are safe! What I live is they always know who is on the school grounds, they come out as soon as you start to walk in....so no one gets overlooked, they will actually take you where you need to go.My kids love it there,and they have had some really great experiences which will stay with them for the rest of their lives! Also, they will not tolerate bullying, they are very strict. I highly recommend this high school. JROTC program is my favorite, and both of my kids are in it, you will learn discipline, respect, structure, how to work as a team, and military drills. The program staff will help you if your child wants to get into the military as well !!!This is the only high school that has a JROTC that is for the “Navy” ( other SF High Sch. are army\u002Fmarines)There is so much to say about this program but not enough time.

My son has been at Rosa Parks for three years now, and I am getting ready to to send my daughter to kindergarten there. We\\u0027ve tried both the Gen Ed (now with a science\u002Ftechnology focus!) and Japanese programs and are very happy with teachers and school culture in both. The ongoing struggle, as seen in the numbers above, is closing the gap in outcomes between kids from high-income and low-income families. My 2¢ as a parent who has watched two principals and teachers in two programs across three grades, is that the school community as a whole is committed to helping not just kids but families through the big changes shaking up neighborhoods: rising rents, evictions, and the departure of many middle-class families who just can\\u0027t afford the city anymore. The good news is that Rosa Parks has a lot of energetic and engaged parents from all walks of life, and remains deeply connected to both Japanese-American and African-American civil rights movements. Yes, there are two programs, but the school feels unified. The entire school starts the day together in physical activity (alternating Japanese calisthetics and the Cha-Cha Slide), then kids get mixed into combined small groups for reading practice. All the kids spend lots of time with a garden teacher, with the plants and chickens as the basis for science lessons and weekly salad lunches. All the kids see performances at nearby Civic Center arts organizations. All the kids do engineering and science projects in the new hands-on learning studio. (As an aside, the school has a partnership with Boys and Girls Club, which means that my son spends his afternoons getting music lessons and homework help at the clubhouse on Fulton and Gough -- it\\u0027s the best deal in SF.)

On the positive side, most teachers were deeply committed to the kids and were extremely skilled, almost heroic, instructors. Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!
