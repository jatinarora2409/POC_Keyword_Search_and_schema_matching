My child was happy here the first few years so the very serious systemic problems were originally masked by those things. There are mysterious staff disappearances (firings?) without warning or explanation (and after they get your deposit money). I never thought much of this until something very troubling happened to my child there. The reaction from the administrator was not with concern to my child at all, but rather blame, finger-pointing at me and my child, and accusations of lying (after years with no complaints or issues to or about the school).

Expect little supervision. Children are given few basic playground accessories to entertain themselves, so in the absence of having a ball to toss around, they choose to throw sticks and rocks. We made the mistake of trying to make things work, trying different classrooms and teachers, and it went from barely adequate to horrible the last year. No communication from the teacher - ZERO. No response to emails, no given phone number. No updates on progress. Our child did NOTHING for two months, and we were never notified, nor did the teacher address the issue. Every behavioral discussion, which were frequent given the horrible environment our child was subjected to, was handled at the director level.

Our son needed a small class size for the extra attention, and we were so lucky to find Mr. Darcy\\u0027s Class. It would be impossible for our son to sit still in a desk all day. Mr. Darcy has the kids outside several times a day running, climbing trees, doing monkey bars, riding bikes and scooters, jumping rope and being in nature. This physical activity carries over into the classroom so that our son is able to focus for longer periods of time. Mr. Darcy also weaves in handwork, drawing, painting, yarn work, carpentry, and more activities that further develop focus and concentration. Music is combined with math to teach skip counting and multiplication, which makes learning numbers fun and memorable. The kids also learn interpersonal and social skills. Healthy interactions between children and adults are modeled. Mr. Darcy forms strong bonds with students and show respect and caring. He is firm, fair and consistent in his treatment of the children. Mr. Darcy is 100% tuned in to the children and what they need to succeed. Since the beginning of this school year our child has matured emotionally and developed academically by leaps and bounds. His self-confidence has improved so much. We are forever grateful for the experience, and would highly recommend Mr. Darcy’s class.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":4821331,\"maponicsId\":1896948,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Ftexas\u002Faustin\u002F21331-Mr-Darcys-Class\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16700011,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"May 28, 2015\",\"review\":\"We love Mr Darcy and Mrs Darcy- they\\u0027ve provided a enviroment for our son to flourish as a student and a person. in a larger setting he was the outside, but he\\u0027s now given the attention and structure so that he\\u0027s delveloping to a amazing student and compassionate person\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":4821331,\"maponicsId\":1611144,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Ftexas\u002Faustin\u002F21331-Mr-Darcys-Class\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":8691211,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Mar 8, 2015\",\"review\":\"Wow, where to begin!! If any of you are interested in waldorf schooling or even a more natural, holistic, whole child approach to learning with a one on one fashion, this is it!! I can\\u0027t say enough about Mr Darcy. He is a Humble mentor, and a father\u002Fgrandfather figure for the children. My two girls went to him last year for 3rd and second grade. This was a great introduction, and a more home like experience for their first \\\"school years\\\" as they were homeschoolers before. David is trained with a waldorf background and psychology, I believe, and it shows. He has exteme patience with the children and knows how to handle situations calmly and with the utmost care and integrity. The learning is not heavy with grades, but more of a portfolio style. We would still be going to him had we not moved farther away. We miss him dearly. Everytime I look at my girls books from his school year, I tear up. If you are looking for a deeper meaning to education that inspires the mind and enriches the soul of not only the students but their families as well, give DaVid a call, he\\u0027s your man!!Smiling face (black and white) This is the kind of education we all deserve.

St. Gabriel\\u0027s certainly delivers an academic advantage, actively presents virtue as a cornerstone, and calls each student to lead. While school administrators are positively engaged, the parents of St. Gabriel\\u0027s deliver the solid foundation. From there, St. Gabriel\\u0027s attracts and retains the highest quality faculty and maintains a very low teacher to student ratio. Having a choice, my wife and I choose St. Gabriel\\u0027s Catholic School. Giving back, we accept every volunteer opportunity at this fine academic school.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":4808428,\"maponicsId\":1127832,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Ftexas\u002Faustin\u002F8428-St.-Gabriels-Catholic-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":8641977,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Aug 3, 2011\",\"review\":\"We wanted a challenging academic environment, but still wanted a place where our children would have fun, feel safe and be surrounded by the values we believe are so important.

Regents rose to the top of the list. We interviewed everyone who would talk to us. Every single person, including teachers and a coach from a nearby private school raved about Regents. One teacher quoted, \\\"every family I know from Regents have one thing in common, they have the absolute best family bond and fun together, if I only knew what they did over there to make such great families.\\\" That interview stuck with us. We made the move and prayed for our application to be accepted. 1 1\u002F2 years later we could not be happier. It is an amazing community. From the board to the teachers and staff, everyone genuinely loves what they do and excel in their field of expertise. Regents comes alongside the parents to help us to raise intellectual, articulate God-loving children into young adults. Our children are taught to think for yourself, articulate your beliefs with respect and honor and stand for what you believe in.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":4811519,\"maponicsId\":1282183,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Ftexas\u002Faustin\u002F11519-Regents-School-Of-Austin\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":11272140,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Aug 21, 2012\",\"review\":\"Best school for your children!!!

There is a massive problem with kids using drugs IN THE BUILDING DURING SCHOOL and the administration does nothing. Students are offered illegal drugs daily. It’s unavoidable. Yes, there are drugs at every high school, but the role it plays here is absurd and alarming. Kids just slip into the bathroom, vape, and go back to class or they skip class and nobody asks any questions until they’ve reached district limit of absences. Socially it\\u0027s also hard to navigate because it is so crowded and chaotic. Kids who aren\\u0027t academic overachievers or plugged into band, a sport, or theater easily get lost in the shuffle.

The dyslexia grapevine made us aware that typically only one 504 meeting was provided in any public high school. Many parents do know their rights and those of their students. However, it is just not useful to spend the energy to bicker with a system that has no desire to educate students that learn differently. We discovered this in elementary school when the school was unwilling to evaluate our daughter. Thus, began our reliance on a private resource system that provided the assistance our daughter needed, and assisted us in knowing our rights. Public education was not willing to provide the information. It is unfortunate that not all dyslexic students have parents that know their rights to advocate for their students.

Yet, it could benefit from more rigorous standards that motivate students at all levels. At one end of the spectrum grad rates are low for a 5A school, at the other end there are few national merit finalists in each grad class. Extracurricular activities are not incredibly strong. Theater is quite strong. Music related groups are weak but some improve. Band is not an inclusive group. Athletics is a brighter spot as it attempts to reach out to a variety of students.
