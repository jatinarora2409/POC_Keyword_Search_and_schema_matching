Location and a small school were also important to us and we do feel that we made the best choice possible for our children. We are thrilled that Principal Ann moved into the role as Principal after a few years of constant change with Principals - this is not unusual for SF schools. I am confident that my children are safe. They are learning and each is being helped in ways they need (one is now on grade level having been below, the other is way above grade level and is given more challenging texts). We are happy to have 3 more years at Sanchez with our younger child and I\\u0027m thrilled with both childrens education and elementary school experience.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606428,\"maponicsId\":3385079,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6428-Sanchez-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665211,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 29, 2018\",\"review\":\"We have been parents of a Sanchez child for two years (Kindergarten and first grade), and are very happy with the school.

She has had a wonderful year with two very smart, caring, experienced professional teachers. They have done an incredible job of fostering the social and emotional development of the students - all teachers are trained in Responsive Classroom, which is very well-respected approach to creating a caring classroom and school community. I was very impressed with the scope and sequence of the curriculum this year. Students studied the lifecycle of pumpkins (fall), trout (winter\u002Fspring), and now recycling (spring), and have studied trees throughout the year. Each topic is covered in every subject - math, science, language arts (reading \\u0026 writing) - and related activities in art, music and Farm and Garden, followed by a culminating field trip! They have made a series of books throughout Kindergarten, with each student contributing his\u002Fher ideas, drawings and written words, and you can see the incredible growth over the course of the year. The parent community is diverse, warm and welcoming...Most are working parents and there is robust after care, vacation camps and summer camps offered on-site with fun and engaging staff. It has a very low-key, down-to-earth feel compared to most private schools in SF. The only place where is might not measure up to other schools is facilities. There is a very limited library by the lower school building, there is no common room space in the lower school as all events are held outside on the yard, which works well for the most part. There is no cafeteria and kids eat outside, but that seems to work well. Kids don\\u0027t care at all! If you visit other schools you will see a wide range of facilities. I think their priorities are on getting and keeping good teachers rather than fancy facilities, which is how it should be.The teachers are committed and passionate about their craft.

So before choosing this school make sure you really understand your child, how he\u002Fshe learns, and what their social and emotional needs are and ask the school how they deal with problems and\u002For positive variances in ability.

Our child has a minor sensory processing disorder for which he toewalks and needs to use a stress ball, on occasion (when nervous). This has never been disturbing to anyone or preventing him from learning (he’s very academic and on top of all he needs to know). We were 100% transparent with the school and the attitude we faced, even before they met our child, was disappointing to say the least. I will not forget how the face of the interviewer changed and his smile disappeared when we mentioned that our child has been seeing an OT once a week. He even recommended other schools to look at (on our interview at this school!). Come the ‘play date’, one of the parent volunteers explained the aim of it was to ‘screen out’ and also that ‘siblings are guaranteed a spot, unless, of course, they have learning differences’. Her exact words - verbatim. It was clear to us that the SF Friends does not include quite everyone in play. Come admission decision, in line with our expectations, were got a no. Our child is a late summer birthday, so when I asked if it is possible to reapply, I was rudely cut off - ‘Absolutely not”. The SF Friends school markets itself heavily on diversity and inclusion, but makes very marginal efforts. Let’s be honest, how hard is it to have families of different nationalities and socio-economical backgrounds ina a city like San Francisco. Stop the first random 100 people on Valencia St and…congratulations, you just found representatives of 20 nations. This experience is bitter for us, so I would offer a piece of advise to prospective families is - if your child has any learning difference (however minor), sees a speech specialist\u002FOT or whatever - don’t bother with this school. They just don’t get it. Spare yourself and your child the unneeded humiliation. Even if the child does get in, chances are they’d never be fully included in the play.\",\"reviewerRating\":1,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":613615,\"maponicsId\":3936477,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F13615-San-Francisco-Friends-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16685073,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 18, 2018\",\"review\":\"In general, not happy at all.

She has had a wonderful year with two very smart, caring, experienced professional teachers. They have done an incredible job of fostering the social and emotional development of the students - all teachers are trained in Responsive Classroom, which is very well-respected approach to creating a caring classroom and school community. I was very impressed with the scope and sequence of the curriculum this year. Students studied the lifecycle of pumpkins (fall), trout (winter\u002Fspring), and now recycling (spring), and have studied trees throughout the year. Each topic is covered in every subject - math, science, language arts (reading \\u0026 writing) - and related activities in art, music and Farm and Garden, followed by a culminating field trip! They have made a series of books throughout Kindergarten, with each student contributing his\u002Fher ideas, drawings and written words, and you can see the incredible growth over the course of the year. The parent community is diverse, warm and welcoming...Most are working parents and there is robust after care, vacation camps and summer camps offered on-site with fun and engaging staff. It has a very low-key, down-to-earth feel compared to most private schools in SF. The only place where is might not measure up to other schools is facilities. There is a very limited library by the lower school building, there is no common room space in the lower school as all events are held outside on the yard, which works well for the most part. There is no cafeteria and kids eat outside, but that seems to work well. Kids don\\u0027t care at all! If you visit other schools you will see a wide range of facilities. I think their priorities are on getting and keeping good teachers rather than fancy facilities, which is how it should be.The teachers are committed and passionate about their craft. We get weekly update by email on what they are learning, and suggested activities to do at home to support their learning. Most importantly, my daughter is excited to go to school and to learn.

Incidentally, both kids did very well on the SSATs, which are the tests high schools look at for admission. The school drew us in with its small size and tightly knit community. The school plans to grow in ways that challenge the community to keep small school values in a big school.

The administation is currently weak; head of school seems disengaged in anything other than fundraising. The assistant head of school had 1 year of teaching experience, and it shows. Staff morale is low. The school has taken on a huge cost (~$12 million) to build a new middle school that it may not be able to afford. Core academic skills in writing and reading sometimes take second place to politically correct indoctrination (Steven Colbert used for news!). Kids in middle school lack most basic information about American history, often enter 5th grade unable to write an effective sentence, and struggle with basic math facts. Good drama program, but the art department is weak and music is essentially non-existent. The class sizes are large compared to national norms.

Our child has a minor sensory processing disorder for which he toewalks and needs to use a stress ball, on occasion (when nervous). This has never been disturbing to anyone or preventing him from learning (he’s very academic and on top of all he needs to know). We were 100% transparent with the school and the attitude we faced, even before they met our child, was disappointing to say the least. I will not forget how the face of the interviewer changed and his smile disappeared when we mentioned that our child has been seeing an OT once a week. He even recommended other schools to look at (on our interview at this school!). Come the ‘play date’, one of the parent volunteers explained the aim of it was to ‘screen out’ and also that ‘siblings are guaranteed a spot, unless, of course, they have learning differences’. Her exact words - verbatim. It was clear to us that the SF Friends does not include quite everyone in play. Come admission decision, in line with our expectations, were got a no. Our child is a late summer birthday, so when I asked if it is possible to reapply, I was rudely cut off - ‘Absolutely not”. The SF Friends school markets itself heavily on diversity and inclusion, but makes very marginal efforts. Let’s be honest, how hard is it to have families of different nationalities and socio-economical backgrounds ina a city like San Francisco. Stop the first random 100 people on Valencia St and…congratulations, you just found representatives of 20 nations. This experience is bitter for us, so I would offer a piece of advise to prospective families is - if your child has any learning difference (however minor), sees a speech specialist\u002FOT or whatever - don’t bother with this school. They just don’t get it. Spare yourself and your child the unneeded humiliation. Even if the child does get in, chances are they’d never be fully included in the play.\",\"reviewerRating\":1,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":613615,\"maponicsId\":3936477,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F13615-San-Francisco-Friends-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16685073,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 18, 2018\",\"review\":\"In general, not happy at all.

I think the school does a fantastic job of teaching children who are at such different stages in terms of language acquisition. In fact I think it does a fantastic job of teaching, period. Beyond academic learning, the school has many other things to offer. The setting in the Presidio is beautiful. Because it is still a small school, there is a lot of interaction between the different grades (for example, during recess the 4th grade girls are currently holding gymnastics \\\"classes\\\" for the first grade girls, which is reported back to me with great excitement by my daughter), which really adds to the sense of community. Indeed the location and the size of the school combine to give it a wonderfully warm and cozy atmosphere.

As a non-German speaking parent, I was slightly hesitant to send my son to a full language immersion program.

On the positive side, most teachers were deeply committed to the kids and were extremely skilled, almost heroic, instructors. Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

My son has been at Rosa Parks for three years now, and I am getting ready to to send my daughter to kindergarten there. We\\u0027ve tried both the Gen Ed (now with a science\u002Ftechnology focus!) and Japanese programs and are very happy with teachers and school culture in both. The ongoing struggle, as seen in the numbers above, is closing the gap in outcomes between kids from high-income and low-income families. My 2¢ as a parent who has watched two principals and teachers in two programs across three grades, is that the school community as a whole is committed to helping not just kids but families through the big changes shaking up neighborhoods: rising rents, evictions, and the departure of many middle-class families who just can\\u0027t afford the city anymore. The good news is that Rosa Parks has a lot of energetic and engaged parents from all walks of life, and remains deeply connected to both Japanese-American and African-American civil rights movements. Yes, there are two programs, but the school feels unified. The entire school starts the day together in physical activity (alternating Japanese calisthetics and the Cha-Cha Slide), then kids get mixed into combined small groups for reading practice. All the kids spend lots of time with a garden teacher, with the plants and chickens as the basis for science lessons and weekly salad lunches. All the kids see performances at nearby Civic Center arts organizations. All the kids do engineering and science projects in the new hands-on learning studio. (As an aside, the school has a partnership with Boys and Girls Club, which means that my son spends his afternoons getting music lessons and homework help at the clubhouse on Fulton and Gough -- it\\u0027s the best deal in SF.) Rosa Parks is, as other parents have said, a hidden gem in the heart of San Francisco.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606420,\"maponicsId\":3827582,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6420-Parks-Rosa-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665238,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Nov 18, 2015\",\"review\":\"Rosa Parks is a hidden gem!

In my opinion, Redding has many different communities rather than one tight-knit one which is such a pity as, in appearance, it\\u0027s clearly very diverse but, like the colors of the rainbow, they remain separate from one another. Much needs to be done to bring the many groups together in the hope that there can be more understanding, acceptance, tolerance, inclusiveness and to inevitably create a more harmonious environment for all.Yes, bullying does occur as with every school but instances do seem to be increasing mainly due to the fact that not much, if anything at all, is done to tackle it. The children are called into to the office for a little chat and swiftly sent back to class... Next!The principal is extremely dedicated and she and her team work incredibly hard to run the school as smoothly as possible, however, she is at times struggling to interact with the many different groups that make up the Redding community in a more impactful and relatable level.All that said, the teachers from TK all the way through to 5th Grade are just pure class and the saving grace.

HIGHLY. They changed principals right before school started this year with absolutely no warning. I\\u0027m sure that was deliberate, but it speaks to the transparency of their communication with parents. They did away with GATE, which I don\\u0027t necessarily mind even though my kid qualified for it. However, for \\\"differentiation\\\" they have a two teacher system for each classroom. So, two teachers in the same class for LangArts\u002FSocSciences and for Math\u002FScience. In some classes, it works well. Both teachers teach, communicate with students and parents, etc. In others, it\\u0027s horrible. One teacher does all the work. The other hardly ever speaks to the class, never communicates, certainly doesn\\u0027t help with any so called differentiation methods. School Loop is what they use to track homework and grades and to communicate with the parents. Unfortunately, only some of the teachers bother keeping up with this. You can also forget about getting a timely response to an email (if you have it answered at all). Even though there is a scheduled hour for science, my kid\\u0027s class ends up doing double math the majority of the time. This means their science grades are based on very few assignments in addition to the rather horrible fact that they are not learning much science!It\\u0027s very easy to get lost in the shuffle here.

On the positive side, most teachers were deeply committed to the kids and were extremely skilled, almost heroic, instructors. Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t.

They will graduate in June. Staff members are great! If you have an issue or any questions they always do their best to accommodate you or refer you to the right person. I always feel good about my kids being there, if something were to go wrong I know that the staff\u002Fsecurity will do everything in their power as a team to make sure the students are safe! What I live is they always know who is on the school grounds, they come out as soon as you start to walk in....so no one gets overlooked, they will actually take you where you need to go.My kids love it there,and they have had some really great experiences which will stay with them for the rest of their lives! Also, they will not tolerate bullying, they are very strict. I highly recommend this high school. JROTC program is my favorite, and both of my kids are in it, you will learn discipline, respect, structure, how to work as a team, and military drills. The program staff will help you if your child wants to get into the military as well !!!This is the only high school that has a JROTC that is for the “Navy” ( other SF High Sch. are army\u002Fmarines)There is so much to say about this program but not enough time. This school also, provides lots of clubs your child can join ..which provides structure, and a safe place to make new friends, it can help the kids become more outgoing, and most of all it gives them something to do instead of getting into to trouble.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606344,\"maponicsId\":3953502,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6344-Burton-Phillip-And-Sala-Academic-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16664870,\"reviewedBy\":\"student\",\"datePosted\":\"Aug 12, 2017\",\"review\":\"I\\u0027m currently a sophomore at this school and I think its pretty good because they have a great staff and amazing teachers.

My son has been at Rosa Parks for three years now, and I am getting ready to to send my daughter to kindergarten there. We\\u0027ve tried both the Gen Ed (now with a science\u002Ftechnology focus!) and Japanese programs and are very happy with teachers and school culture in both. The ongoing struggle, as seen in the numbers above, is closing the gap in outcomes between kids from high-income and low-income families. My 2¢ as a parent who has watched two principals and teachers in two programs across three grades, is that the school community as a whole is committed to helping not just kids but families through the big changes shaking up neighborhoods: rising rents, evictions, and the departure of many middle-class families who just can\\u0027t afford the city anymore. The good news is that Rosa Parks has a lot of energetic and engaged parents from all walks of life, and remains deeply connected to both Japanese-American and African-American civil rights movements. Yes, there are two programs, but the school feels unified. The entire school starts the day together in physical activity (alternating Japanese calisthetics and the Cha-Cha Slide), then kids get mixed into combined small groups for reading practice. All the kids spend lots of time with a garden teacher, with the plants and chickens as the basis for science lessons and weekly salad lunches. All the kids see performances at nearby Civic Center arts organizations. All the kids do engineering and science projects in the new hands-on learning studio. (As an aside, the school has a partnership with Boys and Girls Club, which means that my son spends his afternoons getting music lessons and homework help at the clubhouse on Fulton and Gough -- it\\u0027s the best deal in SF.)

On the positive side, most teachers were deeply committed to the kids and were extremely skilled, almost heroic, instructors. Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

Here are my impression FWIW. Mission class sizes are as low as 18 students, Lowell as high as 40+. Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t. Mission wins on architecture, weather, transportation, location and student to faculty ratio. Lowell wins on academic reputation and performance. Both campuses are equally safe with dedicated staff, though Mission\\u0027s makes more of an effort with more to prove.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":1133732,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":14535080,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Mar 6, 2011\",\"review\":\"i love mission lets go bears go mission is the best decision u could ever make there are the best teachers u can learn really quick the teachers are always pushing u to always do ur best and be positive , peace and love, society ,fashion music and to love ur self and u learn who to develop ur skills and how to protect ursef mission high is not th BAD school as some people out there say\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":1068432,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"}],\"schoolGranularRatings\":[{\"schoolId\":289716,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Low Income\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289713,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Test Scores\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289712,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"College Readiness\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289715,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Equity\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"}],\"schoolDistrict\":{\"id\":14313,\"districtName\":\"San Francisco Unified School District\",\"address\":\"555 Franklin Street\",\"city\":\"San Francisco\",\"stateCode\":\"CA\",\"zip\":\"94102\",\"latitude\":37.7795,\"longitude\":-122.4219,\"websiteUrl\":\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.sfusd.edu\",\"greatschoolDistrictOverviewUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002Fsan-francisco-unified-school-district\u002F\"},\"greatschoolParentReviewsUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F#Reviews\",\"elementary\":false,\"middle\":false,\"high\":true,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 22, 2020\"},{\"servesHome\":false,\"parentRating\":5,\"distanceInMiles\":\"1.4\",\"gradeRanges\":\"9 to 12\",\"institutionType\":\"Public\",\"name\":\"Downtown High School\",\"schoolUrl\":\"\u002Fschool\u002F25898\u002FCA\u002FSan-Francisco\u002FDowntown-High-School\",\"searchUrl\":\"\u002Fschool\u002F25898\u002FCA\u002FSan-Francisco\u002FDowntown-High-School\",\"greatSchoolOverviewUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6359-Downtown-High-School\u002F\",\"id\":25898,\"numberOfStudents\":171,\"fullAddress\":\"693 Vermont St, San Francisco, CA 94107\",\"isChoice\":true,\"numReviews\":1,\"studentToTeacherRatio\":13,\"websiteUrl\":\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.sfusd.edu\u002Fen\u002Fschools\u002Fschool-information\u002Fdowntown-high-school.html\",\"schoolReviews\":[{\"schoolId\":8565253,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 9, 2011\",\"review\":\"I\\u0027ve never seen my son so excited to go to school!
