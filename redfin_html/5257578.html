He came from another LAUSD school that was pretty good, and at first it broke our hearts that he was asking us every day to go back to his old school and see his old friends. Having lived in the Valley for eight years, I had of course heard of Wonderland\\u0027s reputation as one of the top three elementary schools in LA (and one of the top schools in CA actually) and always wondered what it would be like if my kids went there, but seeing our son\\u0027s sad little face, I started to question our decision- \\\"Does he really need to have an \\u0027amazing\\u0027 elementary school education? Or is \\u0027good enough\\u0027 good enough for elementary?\\\" Well, we are so happy we stuck to our guns, as now he\\u0027s fully adjusted, doesn\\u0027t want to go back to his old school anymore and is thriving. And now that we have two schools to compare, boy, do we see the difference. Our son now would come home from class, so excited to tell us about the collaborative projects they did in class, like the one on types of energy. He NEVER would tell us what he learned in class at his old school- it would be the same answer every time- \\\"you know, stuff. Like we always do.\\\" At Wonderland, they also learn SCIENCE in 3rd grade, which they did very little of at his old school (in the lower grades anyway). They go to the library twice a week and once a week have music and art (in classrooms that are designated studios for music and art, respectively). I love how in the GATE program, he is surrounded by other high-performing kids, who still love to have fun, but also love learning and are up to being challenged. This challenges him to do his best. Yet the kids are collaborative, as the teachers have them work together and help each other. He has two teachers (one for Language Arts \\u0026 Social Studies, one for Math \\u0026 Science), and they are both wonderful. I\\u0027ve heard the 4th and 5th grade teachers are also excellent. The principal, Mr. Teer is wonderful as well- so involved, helpful, completely present, often at the school events. I get a sense that everybody at the school- the principal and his administrators, the teachers, the parents-- are all working together towards a common goal, and they set the bar high, and that is what makes Wonderland a truly great school.

Wealth is often confused with educational knowledge and your pocket book buys you experience and power that you did not earned and do not deserve. A handful of parents (5-10 parents) dictate the validity of things like a funded library, to a chicken coup and just about everything on campus often with little regard for what others may feel.

I thought I would find a five star organized arts programs, music, computers and other activities like neighboring carpenter ave school has, and especially seeing that carpenter has only 4 stars I felt confident that wonderland would be a far better school and decision for my child. I am dissapointed in wonderland and the lack of programs and supervision. I am now contemplating a move from my native Laurel Canyon to studio city in order to enroll my child at carpenter ave, which even from their tour seems to be aLOT better school, they even have computers which are not found at wonderland, so FYI for parents researching both of these schools I think Carpenter is a better decision, and hopefully Ill see you in the spring after our move.\",\"reviewerRating\":3,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602498,\"maponicsId\":1156515,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2498-Wonderland-Avenue-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":8521195,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Oct 24, 2011\",\"review\":\"We are very happy with the adjunct programs at Wonderland.

I think the only good staff at the school are the principal and the science teacher. Both are impressive and exceptional. Nothing else about the school is notable. There are a lot of BAD teachers at the school who seem to run the show. The school year is predicated by the teacher and can be miserable. One child had abysmal teachers. Each year my child spent all day in a boring class getting screamed at by mean, uninteresting teachers who should have retired ten or 20 years ago. My older child is moving on to a highly gifted magnet, but not without totally turning off to school in the elementary years first. My child was not only not challenged whatsoever all the way through school, but was put into special ed at carpenter for a stretch, which was a joke. The second grade teacher even told me my child must be autistic because she had a hard time teaching to my kid because my child finished work so fast and seemed bored. The next year my child was identified as highly gifted. They have no resources whatsoever for anything that is outside the bell curve. They are incapable of challenging bright children with work that is not rote and the typical worksheet stuff. There is nothing outside the box going on here. They only seem to teach to the standardized tests. My other child had better teachers, but was bullied all of the way through. My main gripe though is the school is SO overcrowded the kids are packed in like sardines. They can\\u0027t run at recess and lunch because there\\u0027s not enough staff watching them. Both my kids have had serious issues with other kids and bullying at the school mainly during recess and lunch and in the star after school program. Some notable memories are one of my kids being chased around by a kid with scissors. Another time my other child was threatened by a child who was wielding a hammer around after school--also in the star after school program.

All of these kids have learning disabilities as well as some degree of giftedness in one or more areas. They could all benefit from remediation which Bridges refuses to do. They also require that each kid have a laptop computer that they bring to school everyday. Instead of working on their writing, they have them type everything on their computers.

Here are our observations about the IHP program:1. Rigorous program for highly gifted students--worth it if you can get in.2. Be prepared to be solicited for a lot of contributions. Each family is expected to give at least $500. Well worth the price of tuition but not appropriate at a public school. Each semester families are asked to give extra money to each teacher. You can opt out of course but for those who opt in and sign their names to the cash gifts, it\\u0027s just in time for teachers to be posting grades. Never sat right with us and Friends of IHP disagreed with out concerns. 3. Lots of homework but not busy type of homework. Assignments are a much higher grade level, and the students do a great job. 4. Almost every IHP student has at least one subject tutor. 5. Student diversity in IHP is way below LAUSD average. 6. Students are motivated, over achievers. Most of them communicate and interact at a very mature level. 7. Teachers are very talented, especially Ms Sofio and Mr Graham. Wish we had more of them! However, some teachers don\\u0027t want to help students who struggle in a subject or fall behind. For instance, after a bad grade in a class the teacher would not meet with us or respond to emails with questions about how we could help. And our child received even less attention after that. Conclusion: IHP is an excellent program but beware of the exclusive atmosphere. Other notes: both our kids love this school, and we\\u0027re glad we sent them there. They made a lot of strong friendships, learned a lot, matured, went on great field trips, etc. We frequently recommend Reed (IHP and other programs) and appreciate that there is such a wonderful public school in our community.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602341,\"maponicsId\":2581299,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fnorth-hollywood\u002F2341-Walter-Reed-Middle-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16652581,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Mar 12, 2017\",\"review\":\"We had a terrible experience at this school.

Most of the teachers seem overwhelmed and unable to provide simple communication on my child\\u0027s progress. I have made repeated attempts to contact teachers, but seldom were any of my calls returned. Additionally, the academic rigor is not what I would have expected for a gifted student. Most importantly to me though, is the fact that my daughter was not treated with respect or compassion by many of the people working in the school. I was continually shocked at the way my daughter described how some of the teachers spoke to the students. I would like to say these are my only complaints, but the complaints are too numerous to mention. However, my biggest complaint would be the school counselor, Ms. Gianni . She was discouraging and rude. She seems to think it is acceptable to point out the flaws in kids, rather than, building up their self-esteem. She was disrespectful to me as a parent and made the past 3 years the worst of my daughter\\u0027s education. I regret not sending my daughter to a different school when I had a chance. There is little effort made in going above and beyond what is expected of them as a school. However, I will make a few exceptions to this statement... Mr. Zwiers tutors kids in his own free time. He was always available after school and went above and beyond what was expected of him. Ms. Bugjik makes learning interesting for her students. She also shows the students that she cares.

She had entered into Walter Reed in 6th grade in hopes of getting into the IHP program. The Humanities Honors kids are definitely treated as 2nd class citizens and it is absolutely NOT the same IHP, even though you have the SLC staff telling you that it is.My daughter did not get into IHP as a 6th grader, even though she was local (in district) and had great standardized test scores (ERB) from an independent private school. Since she came from a private school, she was not in the LAUSD GATE program. We let her stay in hopes of getting into IHP the in 7th grade. In Feb 2015, they informed us that she would get her GATE test, but it never happened due to district backlog. Without regard to her stellar academic performance in the year (4.0) and scoring in the 98th Percentile on district standardized tests, she was again not admitted to IHP. It is only logical to believe that the GATE test would have helped in this matter.So in Jan 2016 (a whole year later), they send another notice for GATE testing. Reluctantly I agree and sign the form (there\\u0027s no point in trying to get into IHP for 8th grade only). My daughter turns in the form, but the GATE office at Walter Reed lost it! I sign a 2nd form, and my daughter turns it in again. The woman accepting the form told her to take the time to check out of her class before showing up for testing. The woman was misinformed (ignorant?) and my daughter missed her test time by a few minutes. If all this horsing around wasn\\u0027t enough, my daughter voluntarily stayed back at school specifically to take the GATE test, forgoing her 3 day class field trip. Certainly my daughter was traumatized by these events.If you\\u0027re coming from a private school, YMMV with Walter Reed. If you can get into IHP, go for it, but if not, I suggest that you NOT let your child get crushed in the big cogs of the LAUSD bureaucratic machine.

I think the only good staff at the school are the principal and the science teacher. Both are impressive and exceptional. Nothing else about the school is notable. There are a lot of BAD teachers at the school who seem to run the show. The school year is predicated by the teacher and can be miserable. One child had abysmal teachers. Each year my child spent all day in a boring class getting screamed at by mean, uninteresting teachers who should have retired ten or 20 years ago. My older child is moving on to a highly gifted magnet, but not without totally turning off to school in the elementary years first. My child was not only not challenged whatsoever all the way through school, but was put into special ed at carpenter for a stretch, which was a joke. The second grade teacher even told me my child must be autistic because she had a hard time teaching to my kid because my child finished work so fast and seemed bored. The next year my child was identified as highly gifted. They have no resources whatsoever for anything that is outside the bell curve. They are incapable of challenging bright children with work that is not rote and the typical worksheet stuff. There is nothing outside the box going on here. They only seem to teach to the standardized tests. My other child had better teachers, but was bullied all of the way through. My main gripe though is the school is SO overcrowded the kids are packed in like sardines. They can\\u0027t run at recess and lunch because there\\u0027s not enough staff watching them. Both my kids have had serious issues with other kids and bullying at the school mainly during recess and lunch and in the star after school program. Some notable memories are one of my kids being chased around by a kid with scissors. Another time my other child was threatened by a child who was wielding a hammer around after school--also in the star after school program. There\\u0027s so many people everywhere it\\u0027s hard to breathe just walking the kids into school in the morning. It seems like there are so many people there they can\\u0027t all be living in studio city because one doesn\\u0027t see as many children out and about in studio city as at the school.

Here are our observations about the IHP program:1. Rigorous program for highly gifted students--worth it if you can get in.2. Be prepared to be solicited for a lot of contributions. Each family is expected to give at least $500. Well worth the price of tuition but not appropriate at a public school. Each semester families are asked to give extra money to each teacher. You can opt out of course but for those who opt in and sign their names to the cash gifts, it\\u0027s just in time for teachers to be posting grades. Never sat right with us and Friends of IHP disagreed with out concerns. 3. Lots of homework but not busy type of homework. Assignments are a much higher grade level, and the students do a great job. 4. Almost every IHP student has at least one subject tutor. 5. Student diversity in IHP is way below LAUSD average. 6. Students are motivated, over achievers. Most of them communicate and interact at a very mature level. 7. Teachers are very talented, especially Ms Sofio and Mr Graham. Wish we had more of them! However, some teachers don\\u0027t want to help students who struggle in a subject or fall behind. For instance, after a bad grade in a class the teacher would not meet with us or respond to emails with questions about how we could help. And our child received even less attention after that. Conclusion: IHP is an excellent program but beware of the exclusive atmosphere. Other notes: both our kids love this school, and we\\u0027re glad we sent them there. They made a lot of strong friendships, learned a lot, matured, went on great field trips, etc. We frequently recommend Reed (IHP and other programs) and appreciate that there is such a wonderful public school in our community.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602341,\"maponicsId\":2581299,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fnorth-hollywood\u002F2341-Walter-Reed-Middle-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16652581,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Mar 12, 2017\",\"review\":\"We had a terrible experience at this school.

Most of the teachers seem overwhelmed and unable to provide simple communication on my child\\u0027s progress. I have made repeated attempts to contact teachers, but seldom were any of my calls returned. Additionally, the academic rigor is not what I would have expected for a gifted student. Most importantly to me though, is the fact that my daughter was not treated with respect or compassion by many of the people working in the school. I was continually shocked at the way my daughter described how some of the teachers spoke to the students. I would like to say these are my only complaints, but the complaints are too numerous to mention. However, my biggest complaint would be the school counselor, Ms. Gianni . She was discouraging and rude. She seems to think it is acceptable to point out the flaws in kids, rather than, building up their self-esteem. She was disrespectful to me as a parent and made the past 3 years the worst of my daughter\\u0027s education. I regret not sending my daughter to a different school when I had a chance. There is little effort made in going above and beyond what is expected of them as a school. However, I will make a few exceptions to this statement... Mr. Zwiers tutors kids in his own free time. He was always available after school and went above and beyond what was expected of him. Ms. Bugjik makes learning interesting for her students. She also shows the students that she cares.

She had entered into Walter Reed in 6th grade in hopes of getting into the IHP program. The Humanities Honors kids are definitely treated as 2nd class citizens and it is absolutely NOT the same IHP, even though you have the SLC staff telling you that it is.My daughter did not get into IHP as a 6th grader, even though she was local (in district) and had great standardized test scores (ERB) from an independent private school. Since she came from a private school, she was not in the LAUSD GATE program. We let her stay in hopes of getting into IHP the in 7th grade. In Feb 2015, they informed us that she would get her GATE test, but it never happened due to district backlog. Without regard to her stellar academic performance in the year (4.0) and scoring in the 98th Percentile on district standardized tests, she was again not admitted to IHP. It is only logical to believe that the GATE test would have helped in this matter.So in Jan 2016 (a whole year later), they send another notice for GATE testing. Reluctantly I agree and sign the form (there\\u0027s no point in trying to get into IHP for 8th grade only). My daughter turns in the form, but the GATE office at Walter Reed lost it! I sign a 2nd form, and my daughter turns it in again. The woman accepting the form told her to take the time to check out of her class before showing up for testing. The woman was misinformed (ignorant?) and my daughter missed her test time by a few minutes. If all this horsing around wasn\\u0027t enough, my daughter voluntarily stayed back at school specifically to take the GATE test, forgoing her 3 day class field trip.

The kids at this school are very rude, mean, and all they like to do is put others down. The administration doesn\\u0027t make things better, by just sitting down, and drinking a cup of coffee. I do not like this school at all. If you like this school, then good for you, this is just my opinion. This school is also filthy. The only really good thing about this school is its music program, but even that- one of the music teachers is really rude, and always puts kids down. I would never ever in my life recommend to send your child to this school.

The teachers are as involved as the parents meaning that if you\\u0027re a parent that isn\\u0027t involved the teachers are less likely to reach out. The teachers don\\u0027t challenge the students as much as they should which isn\\u0027t truly preparing them for college but my assumption is that with so many kids in a class on various levels it must be hard to do so. The EMA program needs to be structured more towards specific disciplines \\u0026 more classes in the arts instead of 1 class per year, also foreign language should be offered as early as freshmen year for reg. students and not just HGM as well more options than Spanish.\",\"reviewerRating\":3,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23,

My two older sisters (both are twins) had been in this school from the start, they just graduated this year in 2013 and they had been accepted in two wonderful colleges. On went to UC Merced and the other in the Art Institute . As, an old student, i do recommend to send your children here, this school mostly treat you like family because of its small size.

I agree that a whole group of cheerleaders can be perceived as intimidating (all thanks to stereotypes) but these assumptions are false. Stereotypes say that cheerleaders are selfish and stupid. Majority of the cheerleaders have high GPAs and take AP and Honors classes. Class of 2013\\u0027s top 3 students consisted of 2 cheerleaders. A lot of the cheerleaders participate in volunteer work and ASB as well. Ms. Angelica is AMAZING.

Having lived in the Valley for eight years, I had of course heard of Wonderland\\u0027s reputation as one of the top three elementary schools in LA (and one of the top schools in CA actually) and always wondered what it would be like if my kids went there, but seeing our son\\u0027s sad little face, I started to question our decision- \\\"Does he really need to have an \\u0027amazing\\u0027 elementary school education?

They go to the library twice a week and once a week have music and art (in classrooms that are designated studios for music and art, respectively). I love how in the GATE program, he is surrounded by other high-performing kids, who still love to have fun, but also love learning and are up to being challenged. This challenges him to do his best. Yet the kids are collaborative, as the teachers have them work together and help each other. He has two teachers (one for Language Arts \\u0026 Social Studies, one for Math \\u0026 Science), and they are both wonderful. I\\u0027ve heard the 4th and 5th grade teachers are also excellent. The principal, Mr. Teer is wonderful as well- so involved, helpful, completely present, often at the school events.

My son LOVED the overnight science field trip. He came home crying because he wanted to go back and kept saying \\\"it was the complete LACK of technology and one-ness with nature that made it so amazing, so beautiful.\\\" He has also started to read voraciously since he started at the school. OK, it would be nice to have computers, but smartboards are cool and lets face it, they will be partnering with computers for the rest of their lives (like it or not). The one thing I would suggest is a typing class so they can do all that writing for the writing program on the home computer, but that is just one for the suggestion box.

I think the only good staff at the school are the principal and the science teacher. Both are impressive and exceptional. Nothing else about the school is notable. There are a lot of BAD teachers at the school who seem to run the show. The school year is predicated by the teacher and can be miserable. One child had abysmal teachers. Each year my child spent all day in a boring class getting screamed at by mean, uninteresting teachers who should have retired ten or 20 years ago. My older child is moving on to a highly gifted magnet, but not without totally turning off to school in the elementary years first. My child was not only not challenged whatsoever all the way through school, but was put into special ed at carpenter for a stretch, which was a joke. The second grade teacher even told me my child must be autistic because she had a hard time teaching to my kid because my child finished work so fast and seemed bored. The next year my child was identified as highly gifted. They have no resources whatsoever for anything that is outside the bell curve. They are incapable of challenging bright children with work that is not rote and the typical worksheet stuff. There is nothing outside the box going on here. They only seem to teach to the standardized tests. My other child had better teachers, but was bullied all of the way through. My main gripe though is the school is SO overcrowded the kids are packed in like sardines. They can\\u0027t run at recess and lunch because there\\u0027s not enough staff watching them. Both my kids have had serious issues with other kids and bullying at the school mainly during recess and lunch and in the star after school program. Some notable memories are one of my kids being chased around by a kid with scissors. Another time my other child was threatened by a child who was wielding a hammer around after school--also in the star after school program. There\\u0027s so many people everywhere it\\u0027s hard to breathe just walking the kids into school in the morning. It seems like there are so many people there they can\\u0027t all be living in studio city because one doesn\\u0027t see as many children out and about in studio city as at the school.

Parent involvement is exceptionally high, and we are very lucky at the school to have such a generous parent community. In these years of deep cuts, the parents have made a significant and real positive impact.

Here are our observations about the IHP program:1. Rigorous program for highly gifted students--worth it if you can get in.2. Be prepared to be solicited for a lot of contributions. Each family is expected to give at least $500. Well worth the price of tuition but not appropriate at a public school. Each semester families are asked to give extra money to each teacher. You can opt out of course but for those who opt in and sign their names to the cash gifts, it\\u0027s just in time for teachers to be posting grades. Never sat right with us and Friends of IHP disagreed with out concerns. 3. Lots of homework but not busy type of homework. Assignments are a much higher grade level, and the students do a great job. 4. Almost every IHP student has at least one subject tutor. 5. Student diversity in IHP is way below LAUSD average. 6. Students are motivated, over achievers. Most of them communicate and interact at a very mature level. 7. Teachers are very talented, especially Ms Sofio and Mr Graham. Wish we had more of them! However, some teachers don\\u0027t want to help students who struggle in a subject or fall behind. For instance, after a bad grade in a class the teacher would not meet with us or respond to emails with questions about how we could help. And our child received even less attention after that. Conclusion: IHP is an excellent program but beware of the exclusive atmosphere. Other notes: both our kids love this school, and we\\u0027re glad we sent them there. They made a lot of strong friendships, learned a lot, matured, went on great field trips, etc. We frequently recommend Reed (IHP and other programs) and appreciate that there is such a wonderful public school in our community.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602341,\"maponicsId\":2581299,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fnorth-hollywood\u002F2341-Walter-Reed-Middle-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16652581,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Mar 12, 2017\",\"review\":\"We had a terrible experience at this school.

I had heard positive things about it from other parents. Additionally, I had a good experience with the school in the past with my son. Unfortunately, I would not say the same thing about this school today.The past three years have been terrible to say the least. Most of the teachers seem overwhelmed and unable to provide simple communication on my child\\u0027s progress. I have made repeated attempts to contact teachers, but seldom were any of my calls returned. Additionally, the academic rigor is not what I would have expected for a gifted student. Most importantly to me though, is the fact that my daughter was not treated with respect or compassion by many of the people working in the school. I was continually shocked at the way my daughter described how some of the teachers spoke to the students. I would like to say these are my only complaints, but the complaints are too numerous to mention. However, my biggest complaint would be the school counselor, Ms. Gianni . She was discouraging and rude. She seems to think it is acceptable to point out the flaws in kids, rather than, building up their self-esteem. She was disrespectful to me as a parent and made the past 3 years the worst of my daughter\\u0027s education. I regret not sending my daughter to a different school when I had a chance. There is little effort made in going above and beyond what is expected of them as a school. However, I will make a few exceptions to this statement... Mr. Zwiers tutors kids in his own free time. He was always available after school and went above and beyond what was expected of him. Ms. Bugjik makes learning interesting for her students. She also shows the students that she cares.

She had entered into Walter Reed in 6th grade in hopes of getting into the IHP program. The Humanities Honors kids are definitely treated as 2nd class citizens and it is absolutely NOT the same IHP, even though you have the SLC staff telling you that it is.My daughter did not get into IHP as a 6th grader, even though she was local (in district) and had great standardized test scores (ERB) from an independent private school. Since she came from a private school, she was not in the LAUSD GATE program. We let her stay in hopes of getting into IHP the in 7th grade. In Feb 2015, they informed us that she would get her GATE test, but it never happened due to district backlog. Without regard to her stellar academic performance in the year (4.0) and scoring in the 98th Percentile on district standardized tests, she was again not admitted to IHP. It is only logical to believe that the GATE test would have helped in this matter.So in Jan 2016 (a whole year later), they send another notice for GATE testing. Reluctantly I agree and sign the form (there\\u0027s no point in trying to get into IHP for 8th grade only). My daughter turns in the form, but the GATE office at Walter Reed lost it! I sign a 2nd form, and my daughter turns it in again. The woman accepting the form told her to take the time to check out of her class before showing up for testing. The woman was misinformed (ignorant?) and my daughter missed her test time by a few minutes. If all this horsing around wasn\\u0027t enough, my daughter voluntarily stayed back at school specifically to take the GATE test, forgoing her 3 day class field trip. Certainly my daughter was traumatized by these events.If you\\u0027re coming from a private school, YMMV with Walter Reed. If you can get into IHP, go for it, but if not, I suggest that you NOT let your child get crushed in the big cogs of the LAUSD bureaucratic machine.

I am currently a sophomore in the HGM (Highly Gifted Magnet) program, and it is amazing. The teachers inspire me and encourage me to learn. When I first enrolled, I did not think I would like the school. That all changed after the first day of school. While the school is indeed in a bad position financially, all LAUSD schools are the same. Many of the students simply do not care about their grades, though they plan to go to college. Everyday, the principal or some students go on the announcements and stress how important \\\"doing your best\\\" is. They also give a CST vocabulary word and its definition. A majority of the teachers truly care for the students and enjoy spreading their knowledge. The school offers many AP courses and there are opportunities to join many clubs\u002Fextracurricular activities. All the administrators are extremely nice, and the safety of the school has improved tenfold since the beginning of my time there.
