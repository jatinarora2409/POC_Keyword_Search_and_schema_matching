Gough is a landmark building noted for its grace, elegance and rich architectural history. An arched entry embellished with Rococo trim welcomes you through an ornate iron gate, and the grand lobby boasts marble floors, and Mediterranean detail.

The home also enjoys a corner orientation that turns your front yard into Lafayette Park, an eleven-acre swath of lush beauty that enjoyed a $10M renovation and has since become the jewel of Pacific Heights. In the morning you\\u0027ll hear birdsong and be surrounded by nature as each window looks out onto  green slopes and towering trees, along with noteworthy Victorians and a slice of the San Francisco Bay.

It is an affordable education with a diverse student body, yet a group of children that show enormous support for each other. The church (closed in 1995) now holds mass for the children.

I just wrote this review to show you what this magnificent school means to me. St. Brigid is a rigorous and centrally located school. It has small classes and each student receives one-on-one attention. Students take Spanish for six years and are immersed in the culture. Sports are also a big part of community life. I played both volleyball and basketball for six years and recommend joining a sports team. My high school application journey was successful, mostly because of how much Saint Brigid prepared me. When application time came around in eighth grade, I got into every high school I applied to. This includes two private schools (University and Bay), one catholic school (Sacred Heart Cathedral) and a public school (Lowell High School). I received a large scholarship from Bay and was accepted into Sacred Heart under the DePaul Program. Now, I attend Lowell, the top public school in the state. I was placed in an honors math program and a junior year Spanish course. I enjoyed my experience at St. Brigid and hope more people take advantage of this magnificent school.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":608112,\"maponicsId\":1552157,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F8112-St.-Brigid-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":8586453,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Nov 14, 2014\",\"review\":\"Best kept academic secret in San Francisco.

Even the eighth graders are friends with the kindergarteners. The big kids watch out for the little kids. Our son loves going to their aftercare program because he gets to spend time with kids in the other grades. There are many extracurricular programs offered after school. Our son takes karate, chess, piano and Mandarin. He also plays on the soccer team which is a great way for the parents to spend time together too.

Much needs to be done to bring the many groups together in the hope that there can be more understanding, acceptance, tolerance, inclusiveness and to inevitably create a more harmonious environment for all.Yes, bullying does occur as with every school but instances do seem to be increasing mainly due to the fact that not much, if anything at all, is done to tackle it. The children are called into to the office for a little chat and swiftly sent back to class... Next!The principal is extremely dedicated and she and her team work incredibly hard to run the school as smoothly as possible, however, she is at times struggling to interact with the many different groups that make up the Redding community in a more impactful and relatable level.All that said, the teachers from TK all the way through to 5th Grade are just pure class and the saving grace.

My special thanks to Ms. Gross and Mrs. Sheredy. My children who did not speak any English became fluent in no time! They could independently do their homework just a couple of months later. The level of academics is what any parent could wish for! 2) Discipline. Your children will definitely will be taught how to behave. I love how each and every teacher in Spring Valley guide and educate their crazy young crowd! 3) The best Principal! Mrs. Kwong knows her students by their names, knows the parents and is always present at school with her incredibly gentle and unique way of managing the school. 4) Amazing field trips.

I just wrote this review to show you what this magnificent school means to me. St. Brigid is a rigorous and centrally located school. It has small classes and each student receives one-on-one attention. Students take Spanish for six years and are immersed in the culture. Sports are also a big part of community life. I played both volleyball and basketball for six years and recommend joining a sports team. My high school application journey was successful, mostly because of how much Saint Brigid prepared me. When application time came around in eighth grade, I got into every high school I applied to. This includes two private schools (University and Bay), one catholic school (Sacred Heart Cathedral) and a public school (Lowell High School).

My college age sophomores were well prepared for college with rigorous study and academics at SHCP. They were able to choose the extracurricular activities that interested them and became leaders in the areas of their interests. There is so much to be involved with at SHCP - theater, tech crew, speech and debate, sports, music, chorus, newspaper, magazine, service clubs, dance – there is literally something for everyone! The sense of community that is built at SHCP is really what makes it stand apart from all other high schools, in my opinion. From day one, staff and faculty make it clear that they are grateful to parents for “allowing” them to educate your child. The community that is built within each class starts at freshman orientation with a class dance and carnival, and ends with a senior grad night lock-in\u002Fdance\u002Fcarnival. Parents are welcomed at freshman orientation with a class Mass and BBQ. I always feel welcomed on campus and find the faculty easy to approach and available to parents.I think the biggest testament of the welcoming spirit and inclusiveness at SHC is that when my college age children are home from school, one of the first places they visit is SHCP. They created lasting bonds with so many of the faculty and staff. Teachers challenged their intellects, listened to them, directed them and cared for them.

It seemed that most have some mental health issues. It reminded me of a psychiatric ward at an institution I used to work at. It was unbelievable.

Much needs to be done to bring the many groups together in the hope that there can be more understanding, acceptance, tolerance, inclusiveness and to inevitably create a more harmonious environment for all.Yes, bullying does occur as with every school but instances do seem to be increasing mainly due to the fact that not much, if anything at all, is done to tackle it. The children are called into to the office for a little chat and swiftly sent back to class... Next!The principal is extremely dedicated and she and her team work incredibly hard to run the school as smoothly as possible, however, she is at times struggling to interact with the many different groups that make up the Redding community in a more impactful and relatable level.All that said, the teachers from TK all the way through to 5th Grade are just pure class and the saving grace.

My son has been at Rosa Parks for three years now, and I am getting ready to to send my daughter to kindergarten there. We\\u0027ve tried both the Gen Ed (now with a science\u002Ftechnology focus!) and Japanese programs and are very happy with teachers and school culture in both. The ongoing struggle, as seen in the numbers above, is closing the gap in outcomes between kids from high-income and low-income families. My 2¢ as a parent who has watched two principals and teachers in two programs across three grades, is that the school community as a whole is committed to helping not just kids but families through the big changes shaking up neighborhoods: rising rents, evictions, and the departure of many middle-class families who just can\\u0027t afford the city anymore. The good news is that Rosa Parks has a lot of energetic and engaged parents from all walks of life, and remains deeply connected to both Japanese-American and African-American civil rights movements. Yes, there are two programs, but the school feels unified. The entire school starts the day together in physical activity (alternating Japanese calisthetics and the Cha-Cha Slide), then kids get mixed into combined small groups for reading practice. All the kids spend lots of time with a garden teacher, with the plants and chickens as the basis for science lessons and weekly salad lunches. All the kids see performances at nearby Civic Center arts organizations. All the kids do engineering and science projects in the new hands-on learning studio.

They did away with GATE, which I don\\u0027t necessarily mind even though my kid qualified for it. However, for \\\"differentiation\\\" they have a two teacher system for each classroom. So, two teachers in the same class for LangArts\u002FSocSciences and for Math\u002FScience. In some classes, it works well. Both teachers teach, communicate with students and parents, etc. In others, it\\u0027s horrible. One teacher does all the work. The other hardly ever speaks to the class, never communicates, certainly doesn\\u0027t help with any so called differentiation methods. School Loop is what they use to track homework and grades and to communicate with the parents. Unfortunately, only some of the teachers bother keeping up with this. You can also forget about getting a timely response to an email (if you have it answered at all). Even though there is a scheduled hour for science, my kid\\u0027s class ends up doing double math the majority of the time. This means their science grades are based on very few assignments in addition to the rather horrible fact that they are not learning much science!It\\u0027s very easy to get lost in the shuffle here.

Unbelievable. I felt comforted when he started that they keep all of the sixth graders separate, and make them take an intro course to each elective so that when they return as seventh graders they know what they enjoyed most and can spend a full year focused on it.

Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t. Mission wins on architecture, weather, transportation, location and student to faculty ratio. Lowell wins on academic reputation and performance.

I always feel good about my kids being there, if something were to go wrong I know that the staff\u002Fsecurity will do everything in their power as a team to make sure the students are safe! What I live is they always know who is on the school grounds, they come out as soon as you start to walk in....so no one gets overlooked, they will actually take you where you need to go.My kids love it there,and they have had some really great experiences which will stay with them for the rest of their lives! Also, they will not tolerate bullying, they are very strict. I highly recommend this high school. JROTC program is my favorite, and both of my kids are in it, you will learn discipline, respect, structure, how to work as a team, and military drills. The program staff will help you if your child wants to get into the military as well !!!This is the only high school that has a JROTC that is for the “Navy” ( other SF High Sch. are army\u002Fmarines)There is so much to say about this program but not enough time.

In my opinion, Redding has many different communities rather than one tight-knit one which is such a pity as, in appearance, it\\u0027s clearly very diverse but, like the colors of the rainbow, they remain separate from one another. Much needs to be done to bring the many groups together in the hope that there can be more understanding, acceptance, tolerance, inclusiveness and to inevitably create a more harmonious environment for all.Yes, bullying does occur as with every school but instances do seem to be increasing mainly due to the fact that not much, if anything at all, is done to tackle it. The children are called into to the office for a little chat and swiftly sent back to class... Next!The principal is extremely dedicated and she and her team work incredibly hard to run the school as smoothly as possible, however, she is at times struggling to interact with the many different groups that make up the Redding community in a more impactful and relatable level.All that said, the teachers from TK all the way through to 5th Grade are just pure class and the saving grace.

On the positive side, most teachers were deeply committed to the kids and were extremely skilled, almost heroic, instructors. Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

Here are my impression FWIW. Mission class sizes are as low as 18 students, Lowell as high as 40+. Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t. Mission wins on architecture, weather, transportation, location and student to faculty ratio. Lowell wins on academic reputation and performance. Both campuses are equally safe with dedicated staff, though Mission\\u0027s makes more of an effort with more to prove.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":1133732,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":14535080,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Mar 6, 2011\",\"review\":\"i love mission lets go bears go mission is the best decision u could ever make there are the best teachers u can learn really quick the teachers are always pushing u to always do ur best and be positive , peace and love, society ,fashion music and to love ur self and u learn who to develop ur skills and how to protect ursef mission high is not th BAD school as some people out there say\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":1068432,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"}],\"schoolGranularRatings\":[{\"schoolId\":289716,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Low Income\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289713,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Test Scores\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289712,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"College Readiness\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289715,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Equity\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"}],\"schoolDistrict\":{\"id\":14313,\"districtName\":\"San Francisco Unified School District\",\"address\":\"555 Franklin Street\",\"city\":\"San Francisco\",\"stateCode\":\"CA\",\"zip\":\"94102\",\"latitude\":37.7795,\"longitude\":-122.4219,\"websiteUrl\":\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.sfusd.edu\",\"greatschoolDistrictOverviewUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002Fsan-francisco-unified-school-district\u002F\"},\"greatschoolParentReviewsUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F#Reviews\",\"elementary\":false,\"middle\":false,\"high\":true,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 22, 2020\"},{\"servesHome\":false,\"parentRating\":5,\"distanceInMiles\":\"2.4\",\"gradeRanges\":\"9 to 12\",\"institutionType\":\"Public\",\"name\":\"Downtown High School\",\"schoolUrl\":\"\u002Fschool\u002F25898\u002FCA\u002FSan-Francisco\u002FDowntown-High-School\",\"searchUrl\":\"\u002Fschool\u002F25898\u002FCA\u002FSan-Francisco\u002FDowntown-High-School\",\"greatSchoolOverviewUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6359-Downtown-High-School\u002F\",\"id\":25898,\"numberOfStudents\":171,\"fullAddress\":\"693 Vermont St, San Francisco, CA 94107\",\"isChoice\":true,\"numReviews\":1,\"studentToTeacherRatio\":13,\"websiteUrl\":\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.sfusd.edu\u002Fen\u002Fschools\u002Fschool-information\u002Fdowntown-high-school.html\",\"schoolReviews\":[{\"schoolId\":8565253,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 9, 2011\",\"review\":\"I\\u0027ve never seen my son so excited to go to school!

An arched entry embellished with Rococo trim welcomes you through an ornate iron gate, and the grand lobby boasts marble floors, and Mediterranean detail. Upstairs, #402's floor plan includes a home office, ample closet space and more luxury 1920s elements, like narrow plank hardwood floors, working fireplace, mullioned windows and an Art Deco tiled bathroom. The home also enjoys a corner orientation that turns your front yard into Lafayette Park, an eleven-acre swath of lush beauty that enjoyed a $10M renovation and has since become the jewel of Pacific Heights. In the morning you'll hear birdsong and be surrounded by nature as each window looks out onto  green slopes and towering trees, along with noteworthy Victorians and a slice of the San Francisco Bay. Within the park you can picnic, play tennis, run the dog off-leash, or simply soak in some of the City's finest views.
