He came from another LAUSD school that was pretty good, and at first it broke our hearts that he was asking us every day to go back to his old school and see his old friends. Having lived in the Valley for eight years, I had of course heard of Wonderland\\u0027s reputation as one of the top three elementary schools in LA (and one of the top schools in CA actually) and always wondered what it would be like if my kids went there, but seeing our son\\u0027s sad little face, I started to question our decision- \\\"Does he really need to have an \\u0027amazing\\u0027 elementary school education? Or is \\u0027good enough\\u0027 good enough for elementary?\\\" Well, we are so happy we stuck to our guns, as now he\\u0027s fully adjusted, doesn\\u0027t want to go back to his old school anymore and is thriving. And now that we have two schools to compare, boy, do we see the difference. Our son now would come home from class, so excited to tell us about the collaborative projects they did in class, like the one on types of energy. He NEVER would tell us what he learned in class at his old school- it would be the same answer every time- \\\"you know, stuff. Like we always do.\\\" At Wonderland, they also learn SCIENCE in 3rd grade, which they did very little of at his old school (in the lower grades anyway).

Wealth is often confused with educational knowledge and your pocket book buys you experience and power that you did not earned and do not deserve. A handful of parents (5-10 parents) dictate the validity of things like a funded library, to a chicken coup and just about everything on campus often with little regard for what others may feel.

I think the only good staff at the school are the principal and the science teacher. Both are impressive and exceptional. Nothing else about the school is notable. There are a lot of BAD teachers at the school who seem to run the show. The school year is predicated by the teacher and can be miserable. One child had abysmal teachers. Each year my child spent all day in a boring class getting screamed at by mean, uninteresting teachers who should have retired ten or 20 years ago. My older child is moving on to a highly gifted magnet, but not without totally turning off to school in the elementary years first. My child was not only not challenged whatsoever all the way through school, but was put into special ed at carpenter for a stretch, which was a joke. The second grade teacher even told me my child must be autistic because she had a hard time teaching to my kid because my child finished work so fast and seemed bored. The next year my child was identified as highly gifted. They have no resources whatsoever for anything that is outside the bell curve. They are incapable of challenging bright children with work that is not rote and the typical worksheet stuff. There is nothing outside the box going on here. They only seem to teach to the standardized tests. My other child had better teachers, but was bullied all of the way through. My main gripe though is the school is SO overcrowded the kids are packed in like sardines. They can\\u0027t run at recess and lunch because there\\u0027s not enough staff watching them. Both my kids have had serious issues with other kids and bullying at the school mainly during recess and lunch and in the star after school program. Some notable memories are one of my kids being chased around by a kid with scissors. Another time my other child was threatened by a child who was wielding a hammer around after school--also in the star after school program. There\\u0027s so many people everywhere it\\u0027s hard to breathe just walking the kids into school in the morning. It seems like there are so many people there they can\\u0027t all be living in studio city because one doesn\\u0027t see as many children out and about in studio city as at the school.

Do I honestly believe our principal would call parents and tell them their child could have the \\\"good\\\" teacher? Please. All of our teachers are excellent (are some better than others? of course), so this idea that there is \\\"one good\\\" teacher is offensive to every teacher at our school. People will always complain. And, they will complain about things that aren\\u0027t even reality. School is a personal thing.

Our oldest son had learning challenges and needed accountability and benefitted from the extra attention he received. We had almost daily contact with his teachers when needed. They use a system called Edline, that helped us always know exactly how he was doing academically. Although they have a strong athletic program, our oldest son was not into sports, but was much more artistic and into music. His time there in their music program blossomed into him ultimately being a music major in college.Our youngest son is in his second year of high school there, currently. He loves sports and excels academically, taking several AP and honors courses. He\\u0027s currently on the basketball team as well as student council. I think the thing we love most about the school is the small classes and close knit family atmosphere. I really believe it has helped both of our sons develop self confidence.

They make an effort to bring all the parents together in activities with the children a few times a year, which is nice.

For her, the diversity of the students has been refreshing and fun, and any concerns we had have been replaced by true satisfaction and a relief that we do not have to commute any distance! She has enjoyed the FREE after school program offered by Team Primetime, through which she has enjoyed Mock Trial, Spanish classes, art (taught by UCLA students) and homework help. My only dissatisfaction has been in the lack of any band or orchestra, which I hear is being developed for the near future.

Often schools have students who are already highly prepared when they enter high school and even though their faculty may be well prepared, they really don\\u0027t have to show any great skills to push these students through. Other schools are the opposite and have real challenges for preparing students so teachers are fighting an uphill battle. At Uni there is a rich variety of academic levels, cultures, and socio-economic levels and the teacher are fabulous at using this to prepare all of the students. No matter where they come from and no matter where they start, the students journey hand in hand sharing academic rigor (AP and Honors classes), their cultures and their experiences on their way to college.

Always bringing in new ideas, the technology is amazing and I can\\u0027t wait until my younger child goes here. As with anything in life, you\\u0027ll have to check out the school for yourself instead of just going by reviews.

The MESA program where he participated in several science fairs and took a full-day trip to the UCLA Brain Institute. The 6th grade trip to Yosemite, where both kids learned what it means to be part of a group working toward a common goal. Both wrote 20,000 word novels as part of NaNoWriMo.

It has a culture that draws both students and parents in and offers them high academic standards, a warm environment and general as well as specific excellence that promotes well rounded human beings. The students are well prepared and no matter where they started, they end up at the top. Often schools have students who are already highly prepared when they enter high school and even though their faculty may be well prepared, they really don\\u0027t have to show any great skills to push these students through. Other schools are the opposite and have real challenges for preparing students so teachers are fighting an uphill battle. At Uni there is a rich variety of academic levels, cultures, and socio-economic levels and the teacher are fabulous at using this to prepare all of the students. No matter where they come from and no matter where they start, the students journey hand in hand sharing academic rigor (AP and Honors classes), their cultures and their experiences on their way to college.
