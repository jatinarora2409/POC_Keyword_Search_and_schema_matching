Having lived in the Valley for eight years, I had of course heard of Wonderland\\u0027s reputation as one of the top three elementary schools in LA (and one of the top schools in CA actually) and always wondered what it would be like if my kids went there, but seeing our son\\u0027s sad little face, I started to question our decision- \\\"Does he really need to have an \\u0027amazing\\u0027 elementary school education? Or is \\u0027good enough\\u0027 good enough for elementary?\\\" Well, we are so happy we stuck to our guns, as now he\\u0027s fully adjusted, doesn\\u0027t want to go back to his old school anymore and is thriving. And now that we have two schools to compare, boy, do we see the difference. Our son now would come home from class, so excited to tell us about the collaborative projects they did in class, like the one on types of energy. He NEVER would tell us what he learned in class at his old school- it would be the same answer every time- \\\"you know, stuff. Like we always do.\\\" At Wonderland, they also learn SCIENCE in 3rd grade, which they did very little of at his old school (in the lower grades anyway). They go to the library twice a week and once a week have music and art (in classrooms that are designated studios for music and art, respectively). I love how in the GATE program, he is surrounded by other high-performing kids, who still love to have fun, but also love learning and are up to being challenged. This challenges him to do his best. Yet the kids are collaborative, as the teachers have them work together and help each other. He has two teachers (one for Language Arts \\u0026 Social Studies, one for Math \\u0026 Science), and they are both wonderful. I\\u0027ve heard the 4th and 5th grade teachers are also excellent. The principal, Mr. Teer is wonderful as well- so involved, helpful, completely present, often at the school events. I get a sense that everybody at the school- the principal and his administrators, the teachers, the parents-- are all working together towards a common goal, and they set the bar high, and that is what makes Wonderland a truly great school. Wonderland also won the National Blue Ribbon this year, one of only 279 schools nationwide to win the award!

Wealth is often confused with educational knowledge and your pocket book buys you experience and power that you did not earned and do not deserve. A handful of parents (5-10 parents) dictate the validity of things like a funded library, to a chicken coup and just about everything on campus often with little regard for what others may feel.

Overall, Valley View is an intimate, pro-active community, with nice children, engaged parents and a bustling PTA. That is off-set by uneven teachers teaching the very lackluster LAUSD curriculum, headed by an incompetent principal.

She still sees around 50% of the TIOH kindergarten class.His teacher said to his therapist that it didn\\u0027t matter how much they tried to fix his problems at school, if it wasn\\u0027t followed through at home. We had no idea what was going on at school. I checked in regularly with all of the teachers and faculty. He was always a delight at home. There were many insinuations as to the root of \\u0027his problems\\u0027 being in his home life.We attended the TIOH nursery school for three years and I was an active member of the temple community. As another parent from a different school put it, I\\u0027m not sure how they are still in business.\",\"reviewerRating\":1,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":620260,\"maponicsId\":2501246,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F20260-Temple-Israel-Of-Hollywood-Day-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16694307,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Oct 24, 2016\",\"review\":\"I taught at Temple Israel for many years and I am very familiar with the different administrations (There have really been two significant administrations, for the most part). I can say with complete honesty and sincerity that 98% of the staff at TIOH are very highly invested in meeting the needs of the students, above all else. They care a great deal about children and how they impact their lives. Like most teachers, they sure aren\\u0027t doing it to get rich. If you take a tour, talk to other parents. They have no reason to lie or exaggerate. During my tenure at TIOH, values, citizenship, fairness, and responsibility were recurring, prioritized themes when mapping out the year. As for the parent with the special needs child who was disappointed or offended by her experience, I won\\u0027t pretend to know the administration\\u0027s reason for wanting that conversation to be private, but it\\u0027s certainly not because the school turns away special needs kids. The school has had deaf students, a student with dwarfism, a downs syndrome student, countless students with processing issues, Aspergers, Anxiety and OCD issues, language problems, and more. The reality is that special needs can take 100 different forms and it would be irresponsible for an administrator to public agree that a shadow for the child is sufficient for the child to succeed in the school\\u0027s environment. The school isn\\u0027t set up to necessarily provide the necessary resources for any kind of special needs kid that comes along. That\\u0027s probably why the administrator preferred a private conversation on the matter. Any kind of attitude, rudeness, etc. I can\\u0027t defend without being witness, but I can say with confidence that the staff as a rule is very professional, considerate, and emotionally invested in doing their best for parents and students.\",\"reviewerRating\":4,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":620260,\"maponicsId\":2335533,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F20260-Temple-Israel-Of-Hollywood-Day-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16694306,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Jul 13, 2015\",\"review\":\"Unless your local public school is terrible and there is no better private option then you should consider this school.

As we were touring all the private schools in the area, we decided to stop by the Open House at our zoned public school, Gardner - just to see for ourselves how much worse it would be. We were shocked to find that we loved everything about Gardner! The way it looks and feels (happy! Filled with art, music and laughter), and mostly its progressive mindset. We were so shaken up that we went back two more times to confirm that our initial impression was not skewed in some way... Our son is now a thriving 2nd grader at Gardner, and we truly do love this school.Gardner Street Elementary is a neighborhood gem with an engaged principal, excellent teachers and helpful staff, and a small but very active parent body that makes things happen. Many students live outside the school zone but they and their parents like Gardner so much that they\\u0027ve chosen to permit in.What makes Gardner so special are its diverse staff and students, family-like atmosphere, and the many \\\"extras\\\". Thanks to annual fundraisers coupled with lots of fun events for kids and families throughout the school year, \\\"non-essential\\\" classes that are not paid for by LAUSD and not offered in many public schools - such as Visual Art, Music, PE, Yoga, Organic Edible Garden, and (new!) Science Lab - are part of the everyday curriculum and available to every child at Gardner. There are many really great afterschool programs to choose from, and occasional workshops for parents\u002Fcaregivers. Campus beautification is ongoing.Besides all the fun, there is serious learning going on as well. Learning to truly *understand* and not just memorize to ace tests. So much learning goes on at school that - as supported by countless studies and best-performing schools in Finland - there are no homework requirements for the younger kids.Most importantly, my child has developed love for reading and learning, he is excited about going to school every day, and he feels safe there.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":4418512,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651566,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 27, 2019\",\"review\":\"We just love Gardner and couldn\\u0027t have had a better experience.

Due to Principal Rosner\\u0027s openness and willingness to collaborate, many parents have been able to be involved in our school. Specifically in our class, parents have been able to volunteer in weekly art classes, lead nutrition lessons (a parent is a nutritionist and designed a workshop with fresh, healthy foods for kids that coincided with the letters of the alphabet they were learning), reading groups in class, chaperoning field trips etc. The high level of parent engagement makes this school very special. The art studio, physical education, and gardening programs are funded entirely by the parent group, Friends of Gardner. These programs enrich the curriculum, and are so beloved by the students. The open house and art show last week was a clear example of the success of the school. As a parent volunteer, I was able to witness the behind the scenes action of the flurry of art teachers and other volunteer parents working hard to display the well designed art installations before the bell hit 3:00. The principal worked alongside the parents, hanging art and maintaining his calm and upbeat demeanor even under the pressure of the clock. The event came together beautifully and I was so proud to be a member of the Gardner community.

We chose our home elementary school over local charters\u002Fmagnets.The reason the school\\u0027s score dropped from an 8 to a 6 is based on last year\\u0027s Common Core tests even though the California Board of Education suspended the state’s school accountability system. Moreover, the Board of Education voted not to produce an Academic Performance Index (API) for the 2014-15 SY (the index uses student results to rank schools and to identify those that need improvement). Many educational professionals strongly believe current testing measures affluence rather than learning. Gardner is a Title 1 school with 50% of its children receiving free\u002Freduced lunch. This creates a socioeconomic and racially diverse school. However, this also means 30% of the students are learning English as a 2nd language and many students have limited access to computers\u002FI-pads compared to counterparts at surrounding schools. This is an important fact as last year\\u0027s test were electronic instead of the paper and pencil method used previously. Unfortunately, in light of these facts, Great Schools chose to adjust Gardner\\u0027s ranking based on last year\\u0027s test scores.Our principal (former vice principal at Wonderland rated a 10) has made positive changes to ensure each teacher at every grade level is exceptional. Teachers are well versed in traditional \\u0026 modern teaching methods. Ample training is provided to teachers to ensure they create a healthy learning environment and one that supports each child to grow emotionally. The children receive P.E. twice a week, music once a week, art once a week and enrichment courses that are provided on a rotational basis such as drama and garden. Additionally, enrichment classes are offered after school such as engineering and robotics. The children at Gardner are wonderful and kind. The landscaping\u002Fbuilding structure provides a beautiful background for learning. The teachers are a perfect blend of loving and strict. Both children and teachers are taught principles of talking circles or peacemaking circles. These circles use a structural framework to build relationships and to address conflict within a community. This in turn creates an environment where children play well together. Lastly, the parents are lovely! They are friendly and involved in making our school wonderful.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":1805342,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651535,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Oct 13, 2015\",\"review\":\"The grade dropped from 8 to 6 for this school.

We have now been out of Larchmont Charter [\\\"LCS\\\"] for 2 years \\u0026 what a great 2 years it has been. So happy we left \\u0026 actually found a well-run school to attend [we are in the arts\u002Ftech academy at Thomas starr king \\\"TSK\\\"]. The additional info that I can provide now, beyond my initial review below, which was made upon first leaving, is that LCS did not teach my son, identified as highly gifted, to the grade standards that LCS said it was teaching. In other words, my son was supposedly being taught at LCS above grade level but when he transferred to TSK middle school --lausd school--, he was significantly BEHIND his grade level--NOT above it. I heard this exact same story from other parents that left LCS \\u0026 went to another school--their child also significantly behind \\u0026 struggling. I attribute that in part or in whole to the poor teachers we experienced for our entire time at LCS [with exception of a couple teachers] \\u0026 the extremely poor administration. Original parents at LCS leaving in droves. Beware to people looking at this school--they talk a good game but are basically awful. Here\\u0027s my old review for why we left: Just left Larchmont this past yr, a tough decision b\u002Fc our child attended LCS k-5 \\u0026 we miss the kids\\u0026parents.There\\u0027re some great aspects of LCS, most important being it\\u0027s 12 grades,but the problems we saw at the start, including poorly trained teachers, cramped inadequate facilities [no lib, gym, computer lab], and a \\\"teach to the middle level of academics continued \\u0026 in fact worsened by the time we went to Selma Campus for 4th \\u0026 5th.Other concerns included erratic\u002Fshaming discipline, inappropriate use of parents in some teaching spots\\u0026 a top down leadership fail so our\\u0026other parents requests for change were resented\u002Fignored.We switched at 6th b\u002Fc it is the most typical time to matriculate for middle school otherwise we would have left MUCH sooner so bad was our experience..Our concerns with LCS were also informed by having an older child who did k-12 in LAUSD \\u0026 not seeing \\\"LCS-type issues\\\" during that time.So, we\\u0027re more savvy consumers, if you will, which I don\\u0027t think is true of many of the gushing reviewers here.I guess my best observation is that the earlier grades were fine, but if you want your child to have an excellent educ, LCS is not your best option for later grades.This is born out by the many spots now available at LCS for 6-11\",\"reviewerRating\":1,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":614718,\"maponicsId\":2341829,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fwest-hollywood\u002F14718-Larchmont-Charter-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16687474,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 31, 2016\",\"review\":\"Larchmont school system has excellent academics, but Fairfax campus has serious social problems. There\\u0027s a bullying problem and ineffectual leadership around solving it. The children of families that donate a lot of money get away with some very bad behavior.The physical bullying improved by creating a supervision program on the playground. However, the school does not have a handle on of the psychological bullying that girls do.At the heart of the problem is the Fairfax administration wanting to insulate themselves from input by parents. This problem started with the former principal of the campus, who went on to be in charge of the whole system. When she left, she replaced herself with someone that would be her \\\"yes man.\\\" The replacement principal lets the teachers do whatever they want. She once was a teacher there and is still friends with the teachers so she can\\u0027t properly guide them. The culture of the Fairfax campus is to admit no wrong when there is a problem, and pat each other on the back in private.It was with great trepidation that we moved to the Selma campus, but it really seems different here. The vibe of the campus is way more open and welcoming. The administration is overworked, but extremely effective in creating a positive social atmosphere. They have multiple mechanisms in place to work out issues. Nothing wild or weird, just counselors and other people willing to talk out the problems that are inevitable for all young people trying to learn how to be good people. All the adults who work there seem to be on board. The teachers genuinely care about all their students, not just the ones who are funding the school. I\\u0027m really pleased that our family stuck it out.I\\u0027m an educator and I know the academics are cutting edge. It\\u0027s apparent in the test scores of the kids from the \\\"poor\\\" demographic who do much better here than they do at regular public schools. That means a lot to our family, having come up from poor to middle class. And so far at this campus, no one has called our child \\\"poor\\\" like they did at Fairfax. The school culture makes it clear that it\\u0027s the wrong thing to do and the adults enforce that.We have friends who go to the Holly Grove campus, and apparently things are good there, too.

We have now been out of Larchmont Charter [\\\"LCS\\\"] for 2 years \\u0026 what a great 2 years it has been. So happy we left \\u0026 actually found a well-run school to attend [we are in the arts\u002Ftech academy at Thomas starr king \\\"TSK\\\"]. The additional info that I can provide now, beyond my initial review below, which was made upon first leaving, is that LCS did not teach my son, identified as highly gifted, to the grade standards that LCS said it was teaching. In other words, my son was supposedly being taught at LCS above grade level but when he transferred to TSK middle school --lausd school--, he was significantly BEHIND his grade level--NOT above it. I heard this exact same story from other parents that left LCS \\u0026 went to another school--their child also significantly behind \\u0026 struggling. I attribute that in part or in whole to the poor teachers we experienced for our entire time at LCS [with exception of a couple teachers] \\u0026 the extremely poor administration. Original parents at LCS leaving in droves. Beware to people looking at this school--they talk a good game but are basically awful. Here\\u0027s my old review for why we left: Just left Larchmont this past yr, a tough decision b\u002Fc our child attended LCS k-5 \\u0026 we miss the kids\\u0026parents.There\\u0027re some great aspects of LCS, most important being it\\u0027s 12 grades,but the problems we saw at the start, including poorly trained teachers, cramped inadequate facilities [no lib, gym, computer lab], and a \\\"teach to the middle level of academics continued \\u0026 in fact worsened by the time we went to Selma Campus for 4th \\u0026 5th.Other concerns included erratic\u002Fshaming discipline, inappropriate use of parents in some teaching spots\\u0026 a top down leadership fail so our\\u0026other parents requests for change were resented\u002Fignored.We switched at 6th b\u002Fc it is the most typical time to matriculate for middle school otherwise we would have left MUCH sooner so bad was our experience..Our concerns with LCS were also informed by having an older child who did k-12 in LAUSD \\u0026 not seeing \\\"LCS-type issues\\\" during that time.So, we\\u0027re more savvy consumers, if you will, which I don\\u0027t think is true of many of the gushing reviewers here.I guess my best observation is that the earlier grades were fine, but if you want your child to have an excellent educ, LCS is not your best option for later grades.This is born out by the many spots now available at LCS for 6-11\",\"reviewerRating\":1,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":614718,\"maponicsId\":2341829,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fwest-hollywood\u002F14718-Larchmont-Charter-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16687474,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 31, 2016\",\"review\":\"Larchmont school system has excellent academics, but Fairfax campus has serious social problems. There\\u0027s a bullying problem and ineffectual leadership around solving it. The children of families that donate a lot of money get away with some very bad behavior.The physical bullying improved by creating a supervision program on the playground. However, the school does not have a handle on of the psychological bullying that girls do.At the heart of the problem is the Fairfax administration wanting to insulate themselves from input by parents. This problem started with the former principal of the campus, who went on to be in charge of the whole system. When she left, she replaced herself with someone that would be her \\\"yes man.\\\" The replacement principal lets the teachers do whatever they want. She once was a teacher there and is still friends with the teachers so she can\\u0027t properly guide them. The culture of the Fairfax campus is to admit no wrong when there is a problem, and pat each other on the back in private.It was with great trepidation that we moved to the Selma campus, but it really seems different here. The vibe of the campus is way more open and welcoming. The administration is overworked, but extremely effective in creating a positive social atmosphere. They have multiple mechanisms in place to work out issues. Nothing wild or weird, just counselors and other people willing to talk out the problems that are inevitable for all young people trying to learn how to be good people. All the adults who work there seem to be on board. The teachers genuinely care about all their students, not just the ones who are funding the school. I\\u0027m really pleased that our family stuck it out.I\\u0027m an educator and I know the academics are cutting edge. It\\u0027s apparent in the test scores of the kids from the \\\"poor\\\" demographic who do much better here than they do at regular public schools.

As we were touring all the private schools in the area, we decided to stop by the Open House at our zoned public school, Gardner - just to see for ourselves how much worse it would be. We were shocked to find that we loved everything about Gardner! The way it looks and feels (happy! Filled with art, music and laughter), and mostly its progressive mindset. We were so shaken up that we went back two more times to confirm that our initial impression was not skewed in some way... Our son is now a thriving 2nd grader at Gardner, and we truly do love this school.Gardner Street Elementary is a neighborhood gem with an engaged principal, excellent teachers and helpful staff, and a small but very active parent body that makes things happen. Many students live outside the school zone but they and their parents like Gardner so much that they\\u0027ve chosen to permit in.What makes Gardner so special are its diverse staff and students, family-like atmosphere, and the many \\\"extras\\\". Thanks to annual fundraisers coupled with lots of fun events for kids and families throughout the school year, \\\"non-essential\\\" classes that are not paid for by LAUSD and not offered in many public schools - such as Visual Art, Music, PE, Yoga, Organic Edible Garden, and (new!) Science Lab - are part of the everyday curriculum and available to every child at Gardner. There are many really great afterschool programs to choose from, and occasional workshops for parents\u002Fcaregivers. Campus beautification is ongoing.Besides all the fun, there is serious learning going on as well. Learning to truly *understand* and not just memorize to ace tests. So much learning goes on at school that - as supported by countless studies and best-performing schools in Finland - there are no homework requirements for the younger kids.Most importantly, my child has developed love for reading and learning, he is excited about going to school every day, and he feels safe there.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":4418512,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651566,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 27, 2019\",\"review\":\"We just love Gardner and couldn\\u0027t have had a better experience.

It was bright and colorful and pleasant to be in. We have had good teachers, met wonderful parents, and became very involved. The school has a great group of parents running the parent group that raises money all year for the programs that LAUSD doesn\\u0027t provide. PE, Music, Art, Yoga and Edible Gardening are all only provided because the parents raise the money. And it\\u0027s not a crazy amount. They aren\\u0027t hounding you for money. It\\u0027s usually through fun events like carnivals or dances. They encourage a monthly donation of as little as 5-10 dollars a month and it\\u0027s totally doable and worth it for what the kids get in the end. Parents don\\u0027t realize that other public schools don\\u0027t offer those programs. But Gardner students are thriving thanks to them. We believe in public schools. And LAUSD has a pretty rough reputation, but this is one of those schools that\\u0027s a diamond in the rough. It is diverse both racially and economically. It\\u0027s has three main languages spoken among students. It has loving and respectful teachers and administration.

My child started off the year almost reading, and now she is on level E (at grade level) and we still have two months left of school. She is also writing on her own. Due to Principal Rosner\\u0027s openness and willingness to collaborate, many parents have been able to be involved in our school. Specifically in our class, parents have been able to volunteer in weekly art classes, lead nutrition lessons (a parent is a nutritionist and designed a workshop with fresh, healthy foods for kids that coincided with the letters of the alphabet they were learning), reading groups in class, chaperoning field trips etc. The high level of parent engagement makes this school very special. The art studio, physical education, and gardening programs are funded entirely by the parent group, Friends of Gardner. These programs enrich the curriculum, and are so beloved by the students. The open house and art show last week was a clear example of the success of the school. As a parent volunteer, I was able to witness the behind the scenes action of the flurry of art teachers and other volunteer parents working hard to display the well designed art installations before the bell hit 3:00. The principal worked alongside the parents, hanging art and maintaining his calm and upbeat demeanor even under the pressure of the clock. The event came together beautifully and I was so proud to be a member of the Gardner community. Students were so happy to have their families at school; the afternoon of student musicians, vibrant artwork, yummy fresh fruits from the garden, and an impressive classroom where student work was proudly displayed was a highlight of the year.

We chose our home elementary school over local charters\u002Fmagnets.The reason the school\\u0027s score dropped from an 8 to a 6 is based on last year\\u0027s Common Core tests even though the California Board of Education suspended the state’s school accountability system. Moreover, the Board of Education voted not to produce an Academic Performance Index (API) for the 2014-15 SY (the index uses student results to rank schools and to identify those that need improvement). Many educational professionals strongly believe current testing measures affluence rather than learning. Gardner is a Title 1 school with 50% of its children receiving free\u002Freduced lunch. This creates a socioeconomic and racially diverse school. However, this also means 30% of the students are learning English as a 2nd language and many students have limited access to computers\u002FI-pads compared to counterparts at surrounding schools. This is an important fact as last year\\u0027s test were electronic instead of the paper and pencil method used previously. Unfortunately, in light of these facts, Great Schools chose to adjust Gardner\\u0027s ranking based on last year\\u0027s test scores.Our principal (former vice principal at Wonderland rated a 10) has made positive changes to ensure each teacher at every grade level is exceptional. Teachers are well versed in traditional \\u0026 modern teaching methods. Ample training is provided to teachers to ensure they create a healthy learning environment and one that supports each child to grow emotionally. The children receive P.E. twice a week, music once a week, art once a week and enrichment courses that are provided on a rotational basis such as drama and garden. Additionally, enrichment classes are offered after school such as engineering and robotics. The children at Gardner are wonderful and kind. The landscaping\u002Fbuilding structure provides a beautiful background for learning. The teachers are a perfect blend of loving and strict. Both children and teachers are taught principles of talking circles or peacemaking circles. These circles use a structural framework to build relationships and to address conflict within a community. This in turn creates an environment where children play well together. Lastly, the parents are lovely!

From clubs, to leadership class, to dance and theatre shows, to great master classes and field trips- she got to do more in Middle school than one might expect in a public school setting. She also took foreign language and visual arts as well as her performing arts classes (dance, music and theatre.). The majority of teachers and staff are at the top of their game and truly care about the student experience at the school. The majority of classes she had showed good academic rigor and expectations for students. The complaints she expressed more than a few times included frustration about the work ethic of the students (not teachers) in some of her classes and the fact that the school could do more to reward all the students that do all the right things instead of pointing focus on poor choices made by some.

My two older sisters (both are twins) had been in this school from the start, they just graduated this year in 2013 and they had been accepted in two wonderful colleges. On went to UC Merced and the other in the Art Institute . As, an old student, i do recommend to send your children here, this school mostly treat you like family because of its small size. Unfortunately, i am not able to attend this school no more due to how far i live from this school, finding a school like this is hard.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":625423,\"maponicsId\":1371003,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fhuntington-park\u002F25423-Aspire-Pacific-Academy\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":5594743,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Nov 26, 2012\",\"review\":\"The school offers more support than its neighboring High Schools in the goal of succeeding in school and achieving the dream to enter College.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":625423,\"maponicsId\":1266367,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fhuntington-park\u002F25423-Aspire-Pacific-Academy\u002F\"}],\"schoolGranularRatings\":[{\"schoolId\":297465,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Equity\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"5\"},{\"schoolId\":334573,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"College Readiness\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"1\"},{\"schoolId\":297466,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Test Scores\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"5\"},{\"schoolId\":297468,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Academic Progress\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"5\"},{\"schoolId\":297464,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Low Income\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"5\"}],\"schoolDistrict\":{\"id\":9940,\"districtName\":\"Los Angeles Unified School District\",\"address\":\"333 South Beaudry Avenue\",\"city\":\"Los Angeles\",\"stateCode\":\"CA\",\"zip\":\"90017\",\"latitude\":34.0561,\"longitude\":-118.257,\"websiteUrl\":\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.lausd.net\",\"greatschoolDistrictOverviewUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002Flos-angeles-unified-school-district\u002F\"},\"greatschoolParentReviewsUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fhuntington-park\u002F25423-Aspire-Pacific-Academy\u002F#Reviews\",\"elementary\":false,\"middle\":true,\"high\":true,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Oct 8, 2020\"},{\"servesHome\":false,\"parentRating\":3,\"distanceInMiles\":\"14.2\",\"gradeRanges\":\"7 to 12\",\"institutionType\":\"Public\",\"name\":\"Dorothy V.

As we were touring all the private schools in the area, we decided to stop by the Open House at our zoned public school, Gardner - just to see for ourselves how much worse it would be. We were shocked to find that we loved everything about Gardner! The way it looks and feels (happy! Filled with art, music and laughter), and mostly its progressive mindset. We were so shaken up that we went back two more times to confirm that our initial impression was not skewed in some way... Our son is now a thriving 2nd grader at Gardner, and we truly do love this school.Gardner Street Elementary is a neighborhood gem with an engaged principal, excellent teachers and helpful staff, and a small but very active parent body that makes things happen. Many students live outside the school zone but they and their parents like Gardner so much that they\\u0027ve chosen to permit in.What makes Gardner so special are its diverse staff and students, family-like atmosphere, and the many \\\"extras\\\". Thanks to annual fundraisers coupled with lots of fun events for kids and families throughout the school year, \\\"non-essential\\\" classes that are not paid for by LAUSD and not offered in many public schools - such as Visual Art, Music, PE, Yoga, Organic Edible Garden, and (new!) Science Lab - are part of the everyday curriculum and available to every child at Gardner. There are many really great afterschool programs to choose from, and occasional workshops for parents\u002Fcaregivers. Campus beautification is ongoing.Besides all the fun, there is serious learning going on as well. Learning to truly *understand* and not just memorize to ace tests. So much learning goes on at school that - as supported by countless studies and best-performing schools in Finland - there are no homework requirements for the younger kids.Most importantly, my child has developed love for reading and learning, he is excited about going to school every day, and he feels safe there.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":4418512,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651566,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 27, 2019\",\"review\":\"We just love Gardner and couldn\\u0027t have had a better experience.

When we walked in it felt different than other schools. It was clean, people were friendly and it felt HAPPY! There were happy children around everywhere. It was bright and colorful and pleasant to be in. We have had good teachers, met wonderful parents, and became very involved. The school has a great group of parents running the parent group that raises money all year for the programs that LAUSD doesn\\u0027t provide. PE, Music, Art, Yoga and Edible Gardening are all only provided because the parents raise the money. And it\\u0027s not a crazy amount. They aren\\u0027t hounding you for money. It\\u0027s usually through fun events like carnivals or dances. They encourage a monthly donation of as little as 5-10 dollars a month and it\\u0027s totally doable and worth it for what the kids get in the end. Parents don\\u0027t realize that other public schools don\\u0027t offer those programs. But Gardner students are thriving thanks to them. We believe in public schools. And LAUSD has a pretty rough reputation, but this is one of those schools that\\u0027s a diamond in the rough. It is diverse both racially and economically. It\\u0027s has three main languages spoken among students. It has loving and respectful teachers and administration.

This is truly a student-centered school, where the children are given the gift of becoming life long learners. The reader\\u0027s and writer\\u0027s workshops are opportunities for children to progress at his or her own rate. My child started off the year almost reading, and now she is on level E (at grade level) and we still have two months left of school. She is also writing on her own. Due to Principal Rosner\\u0027s openness and willingness to collaborate, many parents have been able to be involved in our school. Specifically in our class, parents have been able to volunteer in weekly art classes, lead nutrition lessons (a parent is a nutritionist and designed a workshop with fresh, healthy foods for kids that coincided with the letters of the alphabet they were learning), reading groups in class, chaperoning field trips etc. The high level of parent engagement makes this school very special. The art studio, physical education, and gardening programs are funded entirely by the parent group, Friends of Gardner. These programs enrich the curriculum, and are so beloved by the students. The open house and art show last week was a clear example of the success of the school. As a parent volunteer, I was able to witness the behind the scenes action of the flurry of art teachers and other volunteer parents working hard to display the well designed art installations before the bell hit 3:00. The principal worked alongside the parents, hanging art and maintaining his calm and upbeat demeanor even under the pressure of the clock. The event came together beautifully and I was so proud to be a member of the Gardner community. Students were so happy to have their families at school; the afternoon of student musicians, vibrant artwork, yummy fresh fruits from the garden, and an impressive classroom where student work was proudly displayed was a highlight of the year.

We chose our home elementary school over local charters\u002Fmagnets.The reason the school\\u0027s score dropped from an 8 to a 6 is based on last year\\u0027s Common Core tests even though the California Board of Education suspended the state’s school accountability system. Moreover, the Board of Education voted not to produce an Academic Performance Index (API) for the 2014-15 SY (the index uses student results to rank schools and to identify those that need improvement). Many educational professionals strongly believe current testing measures affluence rather than learning. Gardner is a Title 1 school with 50% of its children receiving free\u002Freduced lunch. This creates a socioeconomic and racially diverse school. However, this also means 30% of the students are learning English as a 2nd language and many students have limited access to computers\u002FI-pads compared to counterparts at surrounding schools. This is an important fact as last year\\u0027s test were electronic instead of the paper and pencil method used previously. Unfortunately, in light of these facts, Great Schools chose to adjust Gardner\\u0027s ranking based on last year\\u0027s test scores.Our principal (former vice principal at Wonderland rated a 10) has made positive changes to ensure each teacher at every grade level is exceptional. Teachers are well versed in traditional \\u0026 modern teaching methods. Ample training is provided to teachers to ensure they create a healthy learning environment and one that supports each child to grow emotionally. The children receive P.E. twice a week, music once a week, art once a week and enrichment courses that are provided on a rotational basis such as drama and garden. Additionally, enrichment classes are offered after school such as engineering and robotics. The children at Gardner are wonderful and kind. The landscaping\u002Fbuilding structure provides a beautiful background for learning. The teachers are a perfect blend of loving and strict. Both children and teachers are taught principles of talking circles or peacemaking circles. These circles use a structural framework to build relationships and to address conflict within a community. This in turn creates an environment where children play well together. Lastly, the parents are lovely! They are friendly and involved in making our school wonderful.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":602098,\"maponicsId\":1805342,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16651535,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Oct 13, 2015\",\"review\":\"The grade dropped from 8 to 6 for this school.

The majority of teachers and staff are at the top of their game and truly care about the student experience at the school. The majority of classes she had showed good academic rigor and expectations for students. The complaints she expressed more than a few times included frustration about the work ethic of the students (not teachers) in some of her classes and the fact that the school could do more to reward all the students that do all the right things instead of pointing focus on poor choices made by some. Overall it was a great MS experience for a high-achieving, self-driven student willing to try all sorts of new things.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":601918,\"maponicsId\":1854387,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Flos-angeles\u002F1918-Hubert-Howe-Bancroft-Middle-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":8511744,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Jul 2, 2014\",\"review\":\"This is a great school.
