The school is not diverse and consists mostly of white, privileged Germans who have no understanding of 21st century American socio\u002Feconomic, gender, or race issues. The school is completely out of touch with how to support diversity. The school is great if your kid needs very very small class sizes and will be living in Germany in the very near future or have just moved from Germany.

Our daughter used to be rather independent before we came to San Francisco; she could play outside alone with her friends and they used to go to Kindergarten on their own. Given that children are less autonomous in the US, we appreciate enormously that GISSV San Francisco gives them a lot of freedom: independent thinking, self-directed learning and making first-hand experiences are highly valued at this school. Furthermore, besides intellectual achievements also social skills and creativity figure prominently in the curriculum.

Clearly GISSV San Francisco proved to us that the school is well worth the investment!What\\u0027s to like about the school:1) Great curriculum! The children learn a lot (more than I did in comparable grades a long time ago), and in Kindergarten an important part of their day is play time. We parents grew up like this and maybe it sounds old-fashioned, but we definitely like the European approach this school takes to education.2) Fantastic teaching staff. \\\"Home room\\\" teachers stay with their students through elementary school and year over year the school has been able to find top notch teachers.3) Small class sizes generally at 10 - 15 students per grade certainly serves us well!4) Community - we like the diverse parent community given I guess the school attracts \\\"like-minded\\\" people from many different backgrounds.5) Location\u002Fsetting - the location in the Presidio allows for lots of out-door play time in the green, and exploring the woods around school.

This is of course due to class size but it also speaks to the training German teacher’s receive and the strengths of the German school curriculum for example the project based Kindergarten and continuity of teacher from Grades 1-4 to name two. Another unexpected highlight is how culturally diverse our San Francisco campus is. There are many families who speak another language other than German at home and many families who only speak English at home but are dedicated to the benefits of bilingual education. Parents of the school have organized Dia de los Muertos, Chinese New Year and Mardi Gras festivals to honor their own cultures, languages and celebrations.

Our daughter is currently in 1st grade and she skips off to school with a smile on her face every morning. What originally attracted us to GISSV (San Francisco campus) was the bilingual education, and we have not been disappointed. When she started kindergarten she didn\\u0027t speak any German and now, just over half way through 1st grade, she can easily make herself understood. I can see that in a year or two she will be completely fluent. For interested parents reading this, I should mention that while I speak rusty German my husband doesn\\u0027t speak any: in my daughter\\u0027s class the families range from those in which German is the mother tongue to those where neither parent speaks a single word of German, and everything in between. I think the school does a fantastic job of teaching children who are at such different stages in terms of language acquisition. In fact I think it does a fantastic job of teaching, period. Beyond academic learning, the school has many other things to offer. The setting in the Presidio is beautiful. Because it is still a small school, there is a lot of interaction between the different grades (for example, during recess the 4th grade girls are currently holding gymnastics \\\"classes\\\" for the first grade girls, which is reported back to me with great excitement by my daughter), which really adds to the sense of community. Indeed the location and the size of the school combine to give it a wonderfully warm and cozy atmosphere. Currently a K through 5 school, a grade is being added each year and it will run up to 8th grade. For our family the San Francisco campus of GISSV has been, and continues to be, an amazing experience.

From 5th grade on, subjects such as Geography, Economics, Ethics, second \\u0026 (optional) third foreign language are taught, in addition to the traditional subjects. 2.

Location - the school is located in the Presidio, and they take full advantage of the beautiful setting. The class goes on a nature walk every Friday where they explore their surroundings. Some of the places the class has explored so far included the Julius Kahn playground, Palace of Fine Arts, and Chrissy Field beach.

This is of course due to class size but it also speaks to the training German teacher’s receive and the strengths of the German school curriculum for example the project based Kindergarten and continuity of teacher from Grades 1-4 to name two.

I think the school does a fantastic job of teaching children who are at such different stages in terms of language acquisition. In fact I think it does a fantastic job of teaching, period. Beyond academic learning, the school has many other things to offer. The setting in the Presidio is beautiful. Because it is still a small school, there is a lot of interaction between the different grades (for example, during recess the 4th grade girls are currently holding gymnastics \\\"classes\\\" for the first grade girls, which is reported back to me with great excitement by my daughter), which really adds to the sense of community. Indeed the location and the size of the school combine to give it a wonderfully warm and cozy atmosphere.

As a non-German speaking parent, I was slightly hesitant to send my son to a full language immersion program. This was completely unnecessary, as he is doing wonderfully and the German method of education--where K is mostly play-based--fit his needs well.

First and foremost, my kids feel safe and happy, and they run into school every morning. The school community has been incredibly welcoming to us as a transfer family, and both of my kids were invited to playdates before classes even began. The social scene is warm and unassuming- no competitive parents or kids here.But we were most interested in academics, and we have been impressed. With two teachers per classroom and very small class sizes, our kids are having an amazing individualized learning experience. The teachers worked with us to make sure my son\\u0027s transition to more challenging academic work was a smooth one. The \\\"specialist\\\" classes (art, science, PE, technology, etc.) are really fun and engaging.The Spanish infusion was the cherry on top for us. It has been easier than we expected for my son to transfer with no prior Spanish experience, and my kindergartener is learning the language so quickly!

It might have been great ten years ago, but not so much anymore. My son attended PreK here last year and that program is excellent. I highly recommend it to any parent who can get in. That program is separate from the actual school, but I thought that the PreK program would be a great indicator of the school. I was hesitant, and still am, about my selection of Rooftop. The turnover in leadership is worrisome, which leads to a lack of consistency in policies and discipline styles. My son is currently in kindergarten and there is a no homework policy for kindergarteners. I\\u0027m not sure if this a good or a bad thing. The scores reflect that the students at the school may not be doing as well as many other schools in the district such as Sunset or Lafayette, etc. who have scores above the 80s. The diversity in this school is rich, but I think that it is fair to say that there is a lack of support for those who are not doing so well at school, as the scores reflect that. I\\u0027m surprised that the school is rated an 8\u002F10 on some websites with scores so low. I think some people want a K-8 school, but the middle school curriculum is not as developed as the elective courses are incredibly limited. Last year, when I asked the previous principal about bullying policies, he stated that bullying happens everywhere and there\\u0027s no way to stop it. That was a huge disappointment, but I decided to stay because my son was used to the environment. I question my decision to stay every day and it may be that next year we are at a different school. The PTA and parents are a great group of people, some of the teachers are better at talking to students than parents, and the technology is severely lacking in the actual school and with the administration. I know that some schools use apps like ClassDojo or other ways to keep their parents informed of class events. I haven\\u0027t received a single email or update from the our kindergarten teacher about what is going on in the classroom. Instead, my son comes home with lots of worksheets.

Generally if a student is attending this school, it\\u0027ll be because at least one of the parents is a Falun Gong practitioner. The kids aren\\u0027t necessarily practitioners, but the majority of the teachers and administrators follow the religion.For some reason the school will try to deny the association with Falun Gong. I\\u0027m not sure why they feel the need to try to hide it. As a comparison, Catholic schools don\\u0027t try to hide the fact they\\u0027re religious schools. It may be due to the horrific persecution in China.The total school attendance is about 40 students, for both middle and high school. While that makes the class sizes small, it also limits the ability of the school to hire quality teachers. When my child attended, the math teacher was not a full-time employee, and taught at other schools. Getting feedback from the teacher was near impossible. When pressed about this, the director actually tried to excuse it with the explanation \\\"this is an arts school.\\\"The religious aspects also make their way into the curriculum. The director put stickers in the art books to hide body parts he found objectionable, and removed a full chapter of the biology book by cutting out the pages. Whether you consider this good or bad probably depends on if you\\u0027re a follower of the religion.My daughter\\u0027s time at the school had good and bad aspects to it, and she feels it was a growing experience for her. I\\u0027d say that parents that practice Falun Gong would probably give the school rave reviews and say it\\u0027s worth the expensive tuition. Perhaps to them it might be, but that\\u0027s based more on the religion than the actual school quality. I personally don\\u0027t think it was worth the price. It has a good arts program, but academically it\\u0027s challenged due to to the size, budget, and religious beliefs.

On the positive side, most teachers were deeply committed to the kids and were extremely skilled, almost heroic, instructors. Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell.

My son has been at Rosa Parks for three years now, and I am getting ready to to send my daughter to kindergarten there. We\\u0027ve tried both the Gen Ed (now with a science\u002Ftechnology focus!) and Japanese programs and are very happy with teachers and school culture in both. The ongoing struggle, as seen in the numbers above, is closing the gap in outcomes between kids from high-income and low-income families. My 2¢ as a parent who has watched two principals and teachers in two programs across three grades, is that the school community as a whole is committed to helping not just kids but families through the big changes shaking up neighborhoods: rising rents, evictions, and the departure of many middle-class families who just can\\u0027t afford the city anymore. The good news is that Rosa Parks has a lot of energetic and engaged parents from all walks of life, and remains deeply connected to both Japanese-American and African-American civil rights movements. Yes, there are two programs, but the school feels unified. The entire school starts the day together in physical activity (alternating Japanese calisthetics and the Cha-Cha Slide), then kids get mixed into combined small groups for reading practice. All the kids spend lots of time with a garden teacher, with the plants and chickens as the basis for science lessons and weekly salad lunches. All the kids see performances at nearby Civic Center arts organizations. All the kids do engineering and science projects in the new hands-on learning studio. (As an aside, the school has a partnership with Boys and Girls Club, which means that my son spends his afternoons getting music lessons and homework help at the clubhouse on Fulton and Gough -- it\\u0027s the best deal in SF.)

In my opinion, Redding has many different communities rather than one tight-knit one which is such a pity as, in appearance, it\\u0027s clearly very diverse but, like the colors of the rainbow, they remain separate from one another. Much needs to be done to bring the many groups together in the hope that there can be more understanding, acceptance, tolerance, inclusiveness and to inevitably create a more harmonious environment for all.Yes, bullying does occur as with every school but instances do seem to be increasing mainly due to the fact that not much, if anything at all, is done to tackle it. The children are called into to the office for a little chat and swiftly sent back to class... Next!The principal is extremely dedicated and she and her team work incredibly hard to run the school as smoothly as possible, however, she is at times struggling to interact with the many different groups that make up the Redding community in a more impactful and relatable level.All that said, the teachers from TK all the way through to 5th Grade are just pure class and the saving grace.

The school also places a strong emphasis on promoting the social and emotional development of its students and creating a strong community and safe learning environment.

A Fantastic bunch....Miss Christ, Mr. Lie, Mr. Talsky, Miss Kramling, Mr. Johnson, Miss Oliver..... the list is long. I could have named many many more. They each made my son feel capable and interested. His counselor, Miss Sendejo helped him change easily from a class that he felt wasn\\u0027t a good match for him. My son has said things like \\\"I never liked history before having Mr. Lie and Mr Talsky, they make it interesting\\\" He is stuggling in Algebra 2 a bit now, and his teacher comes in in her spare time before school and tutors the kids who need it! Unbelievable. I felt comforted when he started that they keep all of the sixth graders separate, and make them take an intro course to each elective so that when they return as seventh graders they know what they enjoyed most and can spend a full year focused on it. The school also has a fully funded (though impacted) after school program run by Sunset Beacon. Thank you A.P. for the great experience!

Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds.

Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t. Mission wins on architecture, weather, transportation, location and student to faculty ratio. Lowell wins on academic reputation and performance. Both campuses are equally safe with dedicated staff, though Mission\\u0027s makes more of an effort with more to prove.\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":1133732,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":14535080,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Mar 6, 2011\",\"review\":\"i love mission lets go bears go mission is the best decision u could ever make there are the best teachers u can learn really quick the teachers are always pushing u to always do ur best and be positive , peace and love, society ,fashion music and to love ur self and u learn who to develop ur skills and how to protect ursef mission high is not th BAD school as some people out there say\",\"reviewerRating\":5,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":1068432,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"}],\"schoolGranularRatings\":[{\"schoolId\":289716,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Low Income\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289713,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Test Scores\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289712,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"College Readiness\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"},{\"schoolId\":289715,\"dataSourceId\":64,\"schoolGranularRatingType\":\"Equity\",\"schoolGranularRatingValue\":\"2\"}],\"schoolDistrict\":{\"id\":14313,\"districtName\":\"San Francisco Unified School District\",\"address\":\"555 Franklin Street\",\"city\":\"San Francisco\",\"stateCode\":\"CA\",\"zip\":\"94102\",\"latitude\":37.7795,\"longitude\":-122.4219,\"websiteUrl\":\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.sfusd.edu\",\"greatschoolDistrictOverviewUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002Fsan-francisco-unified-school-district\u002F\"},\"greatschoolParentReviewsUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F#Reviews\",\"elementary\":false,\"middle\":false,\"high\":true,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 22, 2020\"},{\"servesHome\":false,\"parentRating\":5,\"distanceInMiles\":\"2.1\",\"gradeRanges\":\"9 to 12\",\"institutionType\":\"Public\",\"name\":\"Downtown High School\",\"schoolUrl\":\"\u002Fschool\u002F25898\u002FCA\u002FSan-Francisco\u002FDowntown-High-School\",\"searchUrl\":\"\u002Fschool\u002F25898\u002FCA\u002FSan-Francisco\u002FDowntown-High-School\",\"greatSchoolOverviewUrl\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6359-Downtown-High-School\u002F\",\"id\":25898,\"numberOfStudents\":171,\"fullAddress\":\"693 Vermont St, San Francisco, CA 94107\",\"isChoice\":true,\"numReviews\":1,\"studentToTeacherRatio\":13,\"websiteUrl\":\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.sfusd.edu\u002Fen\u002Fschools\u002Fschool-information\u002Fdowntown-high-school.html\",\"schoolReviews\":[{\"schoolId\":8565253,\"reviewedBy\":\"parent\",\"datePosted\":\"Sep 9, 2011\",\"review\":\"I\\u0027ve never seen my son so excited to go to school!

I always feel good about my kids being there, if something were to go wrong I know that the staff\u002Fsecurity will do everything in their power as a team to make sure the students are safe! What I live is they always know who is on the school grounds, they come out as soon as you start to walk in....so no one gets overlooked, they will actually take you where you need to go.My kids love it there,and they have had some really great experiences which will stay with them for the rest of their lives! Also, they will not tolerate bullying, they are very strict. I highly recommend this high school. JROTC program is my favorite, and both of my kids are in it, you will learn discipline, respect, structure, how to work as a team, and military drills. The program staff will help you if your child wants to get into the military as well !!!This is the only high school that has a JROTC that is for the “Navy” ( other SF High Sch. are army\u002Fmarines)There is so much to say about this program but not enough time.

On the positive side, most teachers were deeply committed to the kids and were extremely skilled, almost heroic, instructors. Two were breathtakingly bad; a drama class consisted of little besides learning a Shakespeare soliloquy, with no analysis or acting involved. To be fair, most of the year my son reported he was happy with the school and I think the administration tried to do its best for him and other students.Mission is proud of its diversity, and it adds a great richness to the school. I think it’s fair to say that in Mission’s case, the diversity is ethnic and national, and there is little social or economic diversity. Most kids come from low-income families with really difficult, even traumatic, backgrounds. Mission works hard to lift up these kids--it is, I think, the school’s strongest value. The problem, however, is that the attention and emotional energy required to support kids through their traumas (including homelessness, gangs, murders of loved ones) means that less energy is available to provide a safe and structured education for the kids without these challenged backgrounds. Classrooms are often loud and chaotic because there are few rules or consequences for bad behavior.\",\"reviewerRating\":2,\"lastUpdatedDate\":\"Sep 23, 2020\",\"institutionGreatschoolId\":606411,\"maponicsId\":3560677,\"url\":\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatschools.org\u002Fcalifornia\u002Fsan-francisco\u002F6411-Mission-High-School\u002F\"},{\"schoolId\":16665146,\"reviewedBy\":\"other\",\"datePosted\":\"Jan 19, 2018\",\"review\":\"This is a great school!

Lowell, since it\\u0027s bigger, offers a greater variety of classes and most are more challenging, Mission partners with City College to fill in the gaps and also grades students on personal achievement rather the curve, which gives them a much better chance to get into college. Both have AP classes, Lowell has more, but Mission encourages more students to take them who normally wouldn\\u0027t. Much more financial support from the district and beneficiaries for Mission (no one has asked us for any money yet, a first!), but there\\u0027s a dedicated, successful fund-raising parent and alumni group from Lowell. Surprisingly, advanced choir students at Mission are required to be able to read music, at Lowell they aren\\u0027t. Mission wins on architecture, weather, transportation, location and student to faculty ratio. Lowell wins on academic reputation and performance.
