The baths are bright and modern, offering a large walk in shower, soaker tub, quartz counters and beautiful tile. The garden unit's style and high-end finishes reflect that of the owner's unit. Modern kitchen with flat panel cabinets, quartz counter tops, Whirlpool appliances, large living room space with a fireplace, wood grain flooring throughout, in-unit laundry, mud room and separate mechanicals.
